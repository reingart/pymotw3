msgstr ""

#: ../../source/glob/index.rst:8
msgid "Use Unix shell rules to find filenames matching a pattern."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/glob/index.rst:10
msgid "Even though the ``glob`` API is small, the module packs a lot of power. It is useful in any situation where a program needs to look for a list of files on the file system with names matching a pattern. To create a list of filenames that all have a certain extension, prefix, or any common string in the middle, use ``glob`` instead of writing custom code to scan the directory contents."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/glob/index.rst:17
msgid "The pattern rules for ``glob`` are not the same as the regular expressions used by the :mod:`re` module. Instead, they follow standard Unix path expansion rules. There are only a few special characters used to implement two different wild-cards and character ranges. The pattern rules are applied to segments of the filename (stopping at the path separator, ``/``). Paths in the pattern can be relative or absolute. Shell variable names and tilde (``~``) are not expanded."

msgid "glob_asterisk.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/glob/index.rst:70
msgid "The pattern matches every path name (file or directory) in the directory dir, without recursing further into subdirectories. The data returned by ``glob()`` is not sorted, so the examples here sort it to make studying the results easier."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/glob/index.rst:95
msgid "To list files in a subdirectory, the subdirectory must be included in the pattern."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/glob/index.rst:102
msgid "The first case shown earlier lists the subdirectory name explicitly, while the second case depends on a wildcard to find the directory."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/glob/index.rst:120
msgid "The results, in this case, are the same. If there was another subdirectory, the wildcard would match both subdirectories and include the filenames from both."
msgstr ""

msgid "Single Character Wildcard"
msgstr ""

msgid "A question mark (``?``) is another wildcard character. It matches any single character in that position in the name."

msgid "Character Ranges"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/glob/index.rst:159
msgid "Use a character range (``[a-z]``) instead of a question mark to match one of several characters.  This example finds all of the files with a digit in the name before the extension."

msgid "glob_charrange.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/glob/index.rst:167
msgid "The character range ``[0-9]`` matches any single digit. The range is ordered based on the character code for each letter/digit, and the dash indicates an unbroken range of sequential characters. The same range value could be written ``[0123456789]``."

msgid "Escaping Meta-characters"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/glob/index.rst:188
msgid "Sometimes it is necessary to search for files with names containing the special meta-characters ``glob`` uses for its patterns. The ``escape()`` function builds a suitable pattern with the special characters \"escaped\" so they are not expanded or interpreted as special by ``glob``."
