msgid "The ``os`` module provides a wrapper for platform specific modules such as :mod:`posix`, :mod:`nt`, and :mod:`mac`. The API for functions available on all platforms should be the same, so using the ``os`` module offers some measure of portability. Not all functions are available on every platform, however. Many of the process management functions described in this summary are not available for Windows."

msgid "The library documentation for ``access()`` includes two special warnings. First, there is not much sense in calling ``access()`` to test whether a file can be opened before actually calling ``open()`` on it. There is a small, but real, window of time between the two calls during which the permissions on the file could change. The other warning applies mostly to networked file systems that extend the POSIX permission semantics. Some file system types may respond to the POSIX call that a process has permission to access a file, then report a failure when the attempt is made using ``open()`` for some reason not tested via the POSIX call. All in all, it is better to call ``open()`` with the required mode and catch the ``IOError`` raised if there is a problem."

Then ``fork()``, and in the parent pause a short amount of time before sending a ``USR1`` signal using ``kill()``. This example uses a short pause to give the child process time to set up the signal handler. A real application, would not need (or want) to call ``sleep()``.  In the child, set up the signal handler and go to sleep for a while to give the parent time to send the signal."
