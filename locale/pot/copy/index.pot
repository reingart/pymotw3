msgid "Provides functions for duplicating objects using shallow or deep copy semantics."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/copy/index.rst:10
msgid "The ``copy`` module includes two functions, ``copy()`` and ``deepcopy()``, for duplicating existing objects."
msgstr ""

msgid "Shallow Copies"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/copy/index.rst:16
msgid "The *shallow copy* created by ``copy()`` is a new container populated with references to the contents of the original object. When making a shallow copy of a ``list`` object, a new ``list`` is constructed and the elements of the original object are appended to it."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/copy/index.rst:0
msgid "copy_shallow.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/copy/index.rst:26
msgid "For a shallow copy, the ``MyClass`` instance is not duplicated, so the reference in the ``dup`` list is to the same object that is in ``my_list``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/copy/index.rst:49
msgid "Deep Copies"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/copy/index.rst:51
msgid "The *deep copy* created by ``deepcopy()`` is a new container populated with copies of the contents of the original object. To make a deep copy of a ``list``, a new ``list`` is constructed, the elements of the original list are copied, and then those copies are appended to the new list."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/copy/index.rst:57
msgid "Replacing the call to ``copy()`` with ``deepcopy()`` makes the difference in the output apparent."
msgstr ""

msgid "copy_deep.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/copy/index.rst:65
msgid "The first element of the list is no longer the same object reference, but when the two objects are compared they still evaluate as being equal."

msgid "Customizing Copy Behavior"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/copy/index.rst:90
msgid "It is possible to control how copies are made using the ``__copy__()`` and ``__deepcopy__()`` special methods."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/copy/index.rst:93
msgid "``__copy__()`` is called without any arguments and should return a shallow copy of the object."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/copy/index.rst:96
msgid "``__deepcopy__()`` is called with a memo dictionary and should return a deep copy of the object. Any member attributes that need to be deep-copied should be passed to ``copy.deepcopy()``, along with the memo dictionary, to control for recursion. (The memo dictionary is explained in more detail later.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "The following example illustrates how the methods are called."

#: ../../source/copy/index.rst:108
msgid "The memo dictionary is used to keep track of the values that have been copied already, so as to avoid infinite recursion."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/copy/index.rst:126
msgid "Recursion in Deep Copy"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/copy/index.rst:128
msgid "To avoid problems with duplicating recursive data structures, ``deepcopy()`` uses a dictionary to track objects that have already been copied. This dictionary is passed to the ``__deepcopy__()`` method so it can be examined there as well."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/copy/index.rst:133
msgid "The next example shows how an interconnected data structure such as a directed graph can help protect against recursion by implementing a ``__deepcopy__()`` method."

msgid "copy_recursion.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/copy/index.rst:141
msgid "The ``Graph`` class includes a few basic directed graph methods. An instance can be initialized with a name and a list of existing nodes to which it is connected. The ``add_connection()`` method is used to set up bidirectional connections. It is also used by the deep copy operator."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/copy/index.rst:147
msgid "The ``__deepcopy__()`` method prints messages to show how it is called, and manages the memo dictionary contents as needed. Instead of copying the entire connection list wholesale, it creates a new list and appends copies of the individual connections to it. That ensures that the memo dictionary is updated as each new node is duplicated, and it avoids recursion issues or extra copies of nodes. As before, the method returns the copied object when it is done."

msgid "Deep Copy for an Object Graph with Cycles"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/copy/index.rst:165
msgid "The graph shown in :figure:`Deep Copy for an Object Graph with Cycles` includes several cycles, but handling the recursion with the memo dictionary prevents the traversal from causing a stack overflow error. When the *root* node is copied, it produces the following output."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/copy/index.rst:206
msgid "The second time the *root* node is encountered, while the *a* node is being copied, ``__deepcopy__()`` detects the recursion and reuses the existing value from the memo dictionary instead of creating a new object."
