msgid "The ``logging`` module defines a standard API for reporting errors and status information from applications and libraries. The key benefit of having the logging API provided by a standard library module is that all Python modules can participate in logging, so an application's log can include messages from third-party modules."

msgid "Logging Components"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/logging/index.rst:19
msgid "The logging system is made up of four interacting types of objects. Each module or application that wants to log uses a ``Logger`` instance to add information to the logs. Invoking the logger creates a ``LogRecord``, which is used to hold the information in memory until it is processed. A ``Logger`` may have a number of ``Handler`` objects configured to receive and process log records. The ``Handler`` uses a ``Formatter`` to turn the log records into output messages."

msgid "Application developers and library authors can both use ``logging``, but each audience has different considerations to keep in mind."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/logging/index.rst:35
msgid "Application developers configure the ``logging`` module, directing the messages to appropriate output channels.  It is possible to log messages with different verbosity levels or to different destinations. Handlers for writing log messages to files, HTTP GET/POST locations, email via SMTP, generic sockets, or OS-specific logging mechanisms are all included, and it is possible to create custom log destination classes for special requirements not handled by any of the built-in classes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/logging/index.rst:44
msgid "Developers of libraries can also use ``logging`` and have even less work to do.  Simply create a logger instance for each context, using an appropriate name, and then log messages using the standard levels. As long as a library uses the logging API with consistent naming and level selections, the application can be configured to show or hide messages from the library, as desired."

msgid "Running the script repeatedly causes more messages to be appended to the file. To create a new file each time the program runs, pass a ``filemode`` argument to ``basicConfig()`` with a value of ``'w'``. Rather than managing the creation of files this way, though, it is better to use a ``RotatingFileHandler``, which creates new files automatically and preserves the old log file at the same time."

msgid "Another useful feature of the ``logging`` API is the ability to produce different messages at different *log levels*. This means code can be instrumented with debug messages, for example, and the log level can be set so that those debug messages are not written on a production system.  :table:`Logging Levels` lists the logging levels defined by ``logging``."
