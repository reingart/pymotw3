#: ../../source/collections/ordereddict.rst:12
msgid "A regular ``dict`` does not track the insertion order, and iterating over it produces the values in order based on how the keys are stored in the hash table, which is in turn influenced by a random value to reduce collisions.  In an ``OrderedDict``, by contrast, the order in which the items are inserted is remembered and used when creating an iterator."

msgid "A regular ``dict`` looks at its contents when testing for equality. An ``OrderedDict`` also considers the order in which the items were added."
