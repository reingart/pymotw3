msgid "http.server includes classes that can form the basis of a web server."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/http.server/index.rst:11
msgid "``http.server`` uses classes from :mod:`socketserver` to create base classes for making HTTP servers. ``HTTPServer`` can be used directly, but the ``BaseHTTPRequestHandler`` is intended to be extended to handle each protocol method (GET, POST, etc.)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/http.server/index.rst:17
msgid "HTTP GET"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/http.server/index.rst:19
msgid "To add support for an HTTP method in a request handler class, implement the method ``do_METHOD()``, replacing ``METHOD`` with the name of the HTTP method (e.g., ``do_GET()``, ``do_POST()``, etc.). For consistency, the request handler methods take no arguments. All of the parameters for the request are parsed by ``BaseHTTPRequestHandler`` and stored as instance attributes of the request instance."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/http.server/index.rst:27
msgid "This example request handler illustrates how to return a response to the client, and some of the local attributes that can be useful in building the response."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/http.server/index.rst:0
msgid "http_server_GET.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/http.server/index.rst:35
msgid "The message text is assembled and then written to :attr:`wfile`, the file handle wrapping the response socket. Each response needs a response code, set via ``send_response()``. If an error code is used (404, 501, etc.), an appropriate default error message is included in the header, or a message can be passed with the error code."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/http.server/index.rst:41
msgid "To run the request handler in a server, pass it to the constructor of ``HTTPServer``, as in the ``__main__`` processing portion of the sample script."
msgstr ""

msgid "Then start the server:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/http.server/index.rst:53
msgid "In a separate terminal, use ``curl`` to access it:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/http.server/index.rst:92
msgid "The output produced by different versions of ``curl`` may vary. If running the examples produces different output, check the version number reported by ``curl``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/http.server/index.rst:99
msgid "HTTP POST"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/http.server/index.rst:101
msgid "Supporting POST requests is a little more work, because the base class does not parse the form data automatically. The :mod:`cgi` module provides the ``FieldStorage`` class which knows how to parse the form, if it is given the correct inputs."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/http.server/index.rst:110
msgid "Run the server in one window:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/http.server/index.rst:118
msgid "The arguments to ``curl`` can include form data to be posted to the server by using the ``-F`` option. The last argument, ``-F datafile=@http_server_GET.py``, posts the contents of the file ``http_server_GET.py`` to illustrate reading file data from the form."

msgid "Threading and Forking"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/http.server/index.rst:158
msgid "``HTTPServer`` is a simple subclass of ``socketserver.TCPServer``, and does not use multiple threads or processes to handle requests. To add threading or forking, create a new class using the appropriate mix-in from :mod:`socketserver`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Run the server in the same way as the other examples."

#: ../../source/http.server/index.rst:175
msgid "Each time the server receives a request, it starts a new thread or process to handle it:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/http.server/index.rst:192
msgid "Swapping ``ForkingMixIn`` for ``ThreadingMixIn`` would achieve similar results, using separate processes instead of threads."

msgid "Handling Errors"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/http.server/index.rst:198
msgid "Handle errors by calling :meth:`send_error`, passing the appropriate error code and an optional error message.  The entire response (with headers, status code, and body) is generated automatically."

#: ../../source/http.server/index.rst:207
msgid "In this case, a 404 error is always returned."

msgid "The error message is reported to the client using an HTML document as well as the header to indicate an error code."

msgid "Setting Headers"

#: ../../source/http.server/index.rst:250
