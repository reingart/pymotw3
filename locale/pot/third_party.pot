msgid "Although the Python standard library is extensive, there is also a robust ecosystem of modules provided by third-party developers and available from the `Python Package Index`_. This appendix describes some of these modules, and the situations when you might want to use them to supplement or even replace the standard library."

msgid "The :mod:`string` module includes a very basic template tool. Many web frameworks include more powerful template tools, but Jinja2_ and Mako_ are popular standalone alternatives. Both support looping and conditional control structures as well as other features for combining data with a template to produce text output."

msgid "The PLY_ package supports building parsers in the style of the GNU tools lexx and yacc, commonly used for building language compilers. By providing inputs describing the valid tokens, a grammar, and actions to take when each are encountered, it is possible to build fully functional compilers and interpreters, as well as more straightforward data parsers."

# 4b8dbde9927a4911925d8120a59d0c5f

msgid "The :mod:`time` and :mod:`datetime` modules provide functions and classes for manipulating time and date values. Both include functions for parsing strings to turn them into internal representations. The dateutil_ package includes a more flexible parser that makes it easier to build robust applications that are more forgiving of different input formats."
msgstr ""

# 1e45cd0aa9374ae7af15870efce244e5
msgid "The :mod:`datetime` module includes a timezone-aware class for representing a specific time on a specific day. It does not, however, include a full timezone database. The pytz_ package does provide such a database. It is distributed separately from the standard library because it is maintained by other authors and it is updated frequently when timezone and daylight savings time values are changed by the political institutions that control them."

msgid "The examples in the :mod:`sqlite3` section run SQL statements directly and work with low-level data structures. For large applications, it is often desirable to map classes to tables in the database using an *object relational mapper* or ORM. The sqlalchemy_ ORM library provides APIs for associating classes with tables, building queries, and connecting to different types of production-grade relational databases."

msgid "The requests_ package is a very popular replacement for :mod:`urllib.request`. It provides a consistent API for working with remote resources addressable via HTTP, includes robust SSL support, and can use connection pooling for better performance in multi-threaded applications. It also provides features that make it well suited for accessing REST APIs, such as built-in JSON parsing."

msgid "Python's :mod:`html` module includes a basic parser for well-formed HTML data. However, real world data is rarely well structured, making parsing it problematic. The BeautifulSoup_ and PyQuery_ libraries are alternatives to :mod:`html` that are more robust in the face of messy data. Both define APIs for parsing, modifying, and constructing HTML."

msgid "The built-in :mod:`http.server` package includes base classes for creating simple HTTP servers from scratch. It does not offer much support beyond that for building web-based applications, though. The Django_ and Pyramid_ packages are two popular web application frameworks that provide more support for advanced features like request parsing, URL routing, and cookie handling."

msgid "The two standard library modules for building command line interfaces, :mod:`argparse` and :mod:`getopt`, both separate the definition of command line arguments from their parsing and value processing. Alternatively, click_ (the \"Command Line Interface Construction Kit\"), works by defining command processing functions and then associating option and prompt definitions with those commands using decorators."

msgid "cliff_ (\"Command Line Interface Formulation Framework\") provides a set of base classes for defining commands and a plugin system for extending applications with multiple sub-commands that can be distributed in separate packages. It uses :mod:`argparse` to build the help text and argument parser, so the command line processing is familiar."

YAML provides many of the data structure features of JSON in a format that is easier for people to read. The PyYAML_ library provides access to a YAML parser and serializer."

The provided fixture classes can manage loggers, environment variables, temporary files, and more in a consistent and safe way that ensures each test case is completely isolated from others in the suite."

msgid "The :mod:`distutils` module in the standard library for packaging Python modules for distribution and reuse is deprecated. The replacement, setuptools_, is packaged separately from the standard library to make it easier to deliver new versions frequently. The API for setuptools includes tools for building the list of files to include in a package. There are extensions to automatically build the list from the set of files managed by a version control system. For example, using `setuptools-git`_ with source in a git_ repository causes all of the tracked files to be included in the package by default. After a package is built, the twine_ application will upload it to the package index to be shared with other developers."
