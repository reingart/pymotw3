msgid "Implements several types of pseudorandom number generators."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/random/index.rst:10
msgid "The ``random`` module provides a fast pseudorandom number generator based on the *Mersenne Twister* algorithm.  Originally developed to produce inputs for Monte Carlo simulations, Mersenne Twister generates numbers with nearly uniform distribution and a large period, making it suited for a wide range of applications."

msgid "Seeding"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/random/index.rst:74
msgid "``random()`` produces different values each time it is called and has a very large period before it repeats any numbers.  This is useful for producing unique values or variations, but there are times when having the same data set available to be processed in different ways is useful.  One technique is to use a program to generate random values and save them to be processed by a separate step.  That may not be practical for large amounts of data, though, so ``random`` includes the ``seed()`` function for initializing the pseudorandom generator so that it produces an expected set of values."
msgstr ""

msgid "random_seed.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/random/index.rst:88
msgid "The seed value controls the first value produced by the formula used to produce pseudorandom numbers, and since the formula is deterministic it also sets the full sequence produced after the seed is changed.  The argument to ``seed()`` can be any hashable object. The default is to use a platform-specific source of randomness, if one is available.  Otherwise, the current time is used."

msgid "Saving State"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/random/index.rst:116
msgid "The internal state of the pseudorandom algorithm used by ``random()`` can be saved and used to control the numbers produced in subsequent runs.  Restoring the previous state before continuing reduces the likelihood of repeating values or sequences of values from the earlier input.  The ``getstate()`` function returns data that can be used to re-initialize the random number generator later with ``setstate()``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/random/index.rst:0
msgid "random_state.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/random/index.rst:128
msgid "The data returned by ``getstate()`` is an implementation detail, so this example saves the data to a file with :mod:`pickle` but otherwise treats it as a black box.  If the file exists when the program starts, it loads the old state and continues.  Each run produces a few numbers before and after saving the state, to show that restoring the state causes the generator to produce the same values again."

msgid "random_randint.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/random/index.rst:173
msgid "The arguments to ``randint()`` are the ends of the inclusive range for the values.  The numbers can be positive or negative, but the first value should be less than the second."

msgid "random_randrange.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/random/index.rst:197
msgid "``randrange()`` supports a ``step`` argument, in addition to start and stop values, so it is fully equivalent to selecting a random value from ``range(start, stop, step)``.  It is more efficient, because the range is not actually constructed."

msgid "Picking Random Items"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/random/index.rst:218
msgid "One common use for random number generators is to select a random item from a sequence of enumerated values, even if those values are not numbers.  ``random`` includes the ``choice()`` function for making a random selection from a sequence.  This example simulates flipping a coin 10,000 times to count how many times it comes up heads and how many times tails."

msgid "Permutations"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/random/index.rst:251
msgid "A simulation of a card game needs to mix up the deck of cards and then deal them to the players, without using the same card more than once.  Using ``choice()`` could result in the same card being dealt twice, so instead, the deck can be mixed up with ``shuffle()`` and then individual cards removed as they are dealt."

msgid "Sampling"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/random/index.rst:302
msgid "Many simulations need random samples from a population of input values.  The ``sample()`` function generates samples without repeating values and without modifying the input sequence.  This example prints a random sample of words from the system dictionary."

#: ../../source/random/index.rst:344
msgid "In addition to module-level functions, ``random`` includes a ``Random`` class to manage the internal state for several random number generators.  All of the functions described earlier are available as methods of the ``Random`` instances, and each instance can be initialized and used separately, without interfering with the values returned by other instances."

msgid "SystemRandom"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/random/index.rst:385
msgid "Some operating systems provide a random number generator that has access to more sources of entropy that can be introduced into the generator.  ``random`` exposes this feature through the ``SystemRandom`` class, which has the same API as ``Random`` but uses ``os.urandom()`` to generate the values that form the basis of all of the other algorithms."

msgid "Non-uniform Distributions"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/random/index.rst:427
msgid "While the uniform distribution of the values produced by ``random()`` is useful for a lot of purposes, other distributions more accurately model specific situations.  The ``random`` module includes functions to produce values in those distributions, too. They are listed here, but not covered in detail because their uses tend to be specialized and require more complex examples."

msgid "Normal"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/random/index.rst:437
msgid "The *normal* distribution is commonly used for non-uniform continuous values such as grades, heights, weights, etc.  The curve produced by the distribution has a distinctive shape which has lead to it being nicknamed a \"bell curve.\"  ``random`` includes two functions for generating values with a normal distribution, ``normalvariate()`` and the slightly faster ``gauss()`` (the normal distribution is also called the Gaussian distribution)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/random/index.rst:445
msgid "The related function, ``lognormvariate()`` produces pseudorandom values where the logarithm of the values is distributed normally. Log-normal distributions are useful for values that are the product of several random variables which do not interact."

#: ../../source/random/index.rst:451
msgid "Approximation"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/random/index.rst:453
msgid "The *triangular* distribution is used as an approximate distribution for small sample sizes.  The \"curve\" of a triangular distribution has low points at known minimum and maximum values, and a high point at the mode, which is estimated based on a \"most likely\" outcome (reflected by the mode argument to ``triangular()``)."

msgid "The Pareto, or power law, distribution matches many observable phenomena and was popularized by *The Long Tail*, by Chris Anderson. The ``paretovariate()`` function is useful for simulating allocation of resources to individuals (wealth to people, demand for musicians, attention to blogs, etc.)."
