msgid "The ``extend_path()`` function is used to modify the search path and change the way sub-modules are imported from within a package so that several different directories can be combined as though they are one. This can be used to override installed versions of packages with development versions, or to combine platform-specific and shared modules into a single package namespace."

#: ../../source/pkgutil/index.rst:25
msgid "The most common way to call ``extend_path()`` is by adding two lines to the ``__init__.py`` inside the package."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/pkgutil/index.rst:33
msgid "``extend_path()`` scans ``sys.path`` for directories that include a subdirectory named for the package given as the second argument.  The list of directories is combined with the path value passed as the first argument and returned as a single list, suitable for use as the package import path."

msgid "While developing enhancements to a project, it is common to need to test changes to an installed package. Replacing the installed copy with a development version may be a bad idea, since it is not necessarily correct and other tools on the system are likely to depend on the installed package."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/pkgutil/index.rst:144
msgid "A completely separate copy of the package could be configured in a development environment using ``virtualenv`` or :mod:`venv`, but for small modifications the overhead of setting up a virtual environment with all of the dependencies may be excessive."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/pkgutil/index.rst:149
msgid "Another option is to use ``pkgutil`` to modify the module search path for modules that belong to the package under development. In this case, however, the path must be reversed so development version overrides the installed version."

It is also possible to add to the search path using ``*.pkg`` files containing directory names. PKG files are similar to the PTH files used by the :mod:`site` module. They can contain directory names, one per line, to be added to the search path for the package."
