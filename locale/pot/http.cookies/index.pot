msgid "Cookies are used as state management for browser-based application, and as such are usually set by the server to be stored and returned by the client. The most trivial example of creating a cookie sets a single name-value pair."

msgid "It is also possible to control the other aspects of a cookie, such as the expiration, path, and domain. In fact, all of the RFC attributes for cookies can be managed through the ``Morsel`` object representing the cookie value."
