#: ../../source/os.path/index.rst:18
msgid "The first set of functions in ``os.path`` can be used to parse strings representing filenames into their component parts. It is important to realize that these functions do not depend on the paths actually existing; they operate solely on the strings."

msgid "``commonprefix()`` takes a list of paths as an argument and returns a single string that represents a common prefix present in all of the paths. The value may represent a path that does not actually exist, and the path separator is not included in the consideration, so the prefix might not stop on a separator boundary."
