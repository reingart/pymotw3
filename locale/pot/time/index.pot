msgid "The ``time`` module provides access to several different types of clocks, each useful for different purposes. The standard system calls like ``time()`` report the system \"wall clock\" time. The ``monotonic()`` clock can be used to measure elapsed time in a long-running process because it is guaranteed never to move backwards, even if the system time is changed. For performance testing, ``perf_counter()`` provides access to the clock with the highest available resolution to make short time measurements more accurate. The CPU time is available through ``clock()``, and ``process_time()`` returns the combined processor time and system time."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/time/index.rst:24
msgid "The implementations expose C library functions for manipulating dates and times.  Since they are tied to the underlying C implementation, some details (such as the start of the epoch and maximum date value supported) are platform-specific.  Refer to the library documentation for complete details."

msgid "The epoch is the start of measurement for time, which for Unix systems is 0:00 on January 1, 1970. Although the value is always a float, actual precision is platform-dependent."

msgid "The float representation is useful when storing or comparing dates, but not as useful for producing human readable representations. For logging or printing time ``ctime()`` can be more useful."

msgid "Monotonic Clocks"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/time/index.rst:146
msgid "Because ``time()`` looks at the system clock, and the system clock can be changed by the user or system services for synchronizing clocks across multiple computers, calling ``time()`` repeatedly may produce values that go forwards and backwards. This can result in unexpected behavior when trying to measure durations or otherwise use those times for computation. Avoid those situations by using ``monotonic()``, which always returns values that go forward."

#: ../../source/time/index.rst:158
msgid "The start point for the monotonic clock is not defined, so return values are only useful for doing calculations with other clock values. In this example the duration of the sleep is measured using ``monotonic()``."

msgid "Calling ``sleep()`` yields control from the current thread and asks it to wait for the system to wake it back up. If a program has only one thread, this effectively blocks the app and it does no work."

msgid "Storing times as elapsed seconds is useful in some situations, but there are times when a program needs to have access to the individual fields of a date (year, month, etc.). The ``time`` module defines ``struct_time`` for holding date and time values with components broken out so they are easy to access. There are several functions that work with ``struct_time`` values instead of floats."

msgid "To change the time zone, set the environment variable ``TZ``, then call ``tzset()``.  The time zone can be specified with a lot of detail, right down to the start and stop times for daylight savings time. It is usually easier to use the time zone name and let the underlying libraries derive the other information, though."
