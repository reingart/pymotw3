#: ../../source/threading/index.rst:136
msgid "Up to this point, the example programs have implicitly waited to exit until all threads have completed their work. Sometimes programs spawn a thread as a *daemon* that runs without blocking the main program from exiting. Using daemon threads is useful for services where there may not be an easy way to interrupt the thread, or where letting the thread die in the middle of its work does not lose or corrupt data (for example, a thread that generates \"heart beats\" for a service monitoring tool). To mark a thread as a daemon, pass ``daemon=True`` when constructing it or call its ``set_daemon()`` method with ``True``.  The default is for threads to not be daemons."

msgid "Although the point of using multiple threads is to run separate operations concurrently, there are times when it is important to be able to synchronize the operations in two or more threads.  Event objects are a simple way to communicate between threads safely.  An ``Event`` manages an internal flag that callers can control with the ``set()`` and ``clear()`` methods. Other threads can use ``wait()`` to pause until the flag is set, effectively blocking progress until allowed to continue."

#: ../../source/threading/index.rst:402
msgid "In addition to synchronizing the operations of threads, it is also important to be able to control access to shared resources to prevent corruption or missed data. Python's built-in data structures (lists, dictionaries, etc.) are thread-safe as a side-effect of having atomic byte-codes for manipulating them (the global interpreter lock used to protect Python's internal data structures is not released in the middle of an update). Other data structures implemented in Python, or simpler types like integers and floats, do not have that protection. To guard against simultaneous access to an object, use a ``Lock`` object."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/threading/index.rst:450
msgid "To find out whether another thread has acquired the lock without holding up the current thread, pass ``False`` for the ``blocking`` argument to ``acquire()``. In the next example, ``worker()`` tries to acquire the lock three separate times and counts how many attempts it has to make to do so. In the mean time, ``lock_holder()`` cycles between holding and releasing the lock, with short pauses in each state used to simulate load."

msgid "Synchronizing Threads"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/threading/index.rst:576
msgid "In addition to using ``Events``, another way of synchronizing threads is through using a ``Condition`` object. Because the ``Condition`` uses a ``Lock``, it can be tied to a shared resource, allowing multiple threads to wait for the resource to be updated.  In this example, the ``consumer()`` threads wait for the ``Condition`` to be set before continuing. The ``producer()`` thread is responsible for setting the condition and notifying the other threads that they can continue."
