msgid "Many applications are structured with a main loop that wraps execution in a global exception handler to trap errors not handled at a lower level.  Another way to achieve the same thing is by setting the ``sys.excepthook`` to a function that takes three arguments (the error type, error value, and traceback) and let it deal with unhandled errors."

msgid "Since there is no ``try:except`` block around the line where the exception is raised the following call to ``print()`` is not run, even though the except hook is set."

#: ../../source/sys/exceptions.rst:47
msgid "There are times when an explicit exception handler is preferred, either for code clarity or to avoid conflicts with libraries that try to install their own ``excepthook``.  In these cases, a common handler function can be created that does not need to have the exception object passed to it explicitly by calling ``exc_info()`` to retrieve the current exception for a thread."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/sys/exceptions.rst:54
msgid "The return value of ``exc_info()`` is a three member tuple containing the exception class, an exception instance, and a traceback.  Using ``exc_info()`` is preferred over the old form (with ``exc_type``, ``exc_value``, and ``exc_traceback``) because it is thread-safe."

msgid "sys_exc_info.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/sys/exceptions.rst:64
msgid "This example avoids introducing a circular reference between the traceback object and a local variable in the current frame by ignoring that part of the return value from ``exc_info()``.  If the traceback is needed (for example, so it can be logged), explicitly delete the local variable (using ``del``) to avoid cycles."

msgid "In the interactive interpreter, there is only one thread of interaction.  Unhandled exceptions in that thread are saved to three variables in ``sys`` (``last_type``, ``last_value``, and ``last_traceback``) to make it easy to retrieve them for debugging.  Using the postmortem debugger in :mod:`pdb` avoids any need to use the values directly."
