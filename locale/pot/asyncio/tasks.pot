#: ../../source/asyncio/tasks.rst:5
msgid "Tasks are one of the primary ways to interact with the event loop. Tasks wrap coroutines and track when they are complete. Tasks are subclasses of ``Future``, so other coroutines can wait for them and each has a result that can be retrieved after the task completes."
msgstr ""

msgid "Starting a Task"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/tasks.rst:14
msgid "To start a task, use ``create_task()`` to create a ``Task`` instance. The resulting task will run as part of the concurrent operations managed by the event loop as long as the loop is running and the coroutine does not return."

#: ../../source/asyncio/tasks.rst:23
msgid "This example waits for the task to return a result before the ``main()`` function exits."

msgid "Canceling a Task"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/tasks.rst:47
msgid "By retaining the ``Task`` object returned from ``create_task()``, it is possible to cancel the operation of the task before it completes."
msgstr ""

msgid "asyncio_cancel_task.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/tasks.rst:55
msgid "This example creates and then cancels a task before starting the event loop. The result is a ``CancelledError`` exception from ``run_until_complete()``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/tasks.rst:75
msgid "If a task is canceled while it is waiting for another concurrent operation, the task is notified of its cancellation by having a ``CancelledError`` exception raised at the point where it is waiting."

#: ../../source/asyncio/tasks.rst:84

msgid "Creating Tasks from Coroutines"

#: ../../source/asyncio/tasks.rst:107
msgid "The ``ensure_future()`` function returns a ``Task`` tied to the execution of a coroutine. That ``Task`` instance can then be passed to other code, which can wait for it without knowing how the original coroutine was constructed or called."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/tasks.rst:116
msgid "Note that the coroutine given to ``ensure_future()`` is not started until something uses ``await`` to allow it to be executed."
