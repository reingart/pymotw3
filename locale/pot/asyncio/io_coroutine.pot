msgid "This section examines alternate versions of the two sample programs implementing a simple echo server and client, using coroutines and the ``asyncio`` streams API instead of the protocol and transport class abstractions. The examples operate at a lower abstraction level than the ``Protocol`` API discussed previously, but the events being processed are similar."

#: ../../source/asyncio/io_coroutine.rst:15
msgid "The server starts by importing the modules it needs to set up ``asyncio`` and :mod:`logging`, and then it creates an event loop object."

#: ../../source/asyncio/io_coroutine.rst:23
msgid "It then defines a coroutine to handle communication. Each time a client connects, a new instance of the coroutine will be invoked so that within the function the code is only communicating with one client at a time. Python's language runtime manages the state for each coroutine instance, so the application code does not need to manage any extra data structures to track separate clients."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/io_coroutine.rst:30
msgid "The arguments to the coroutine are ``StreamReader`` and ``StreamWriter`` instances associated with the new connection. As with the ``Transport``, the client address can be accessed through the writer's method ``get_extra_info()``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/io_coroutine.rst:38
msgid "Although the coroutine is called when the connection is established, there may not be any data to read, yet. To avoid blocking while reading, the coroutine uses ``await`` with the ``read()`` call to allow the event loop to carry on processing other tasks until there is data to read."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/io_coroutine.rst:47
msgid "If the client sends data, it is returned from ``await`` and can be sent back to the client by passing it to the writer. Multiple calls to ``write()`` can be used to buffer outgoing data, and then ``drain()`` is used to flush the results. Since flushing network I/O can block, again ``await`` is used to restore control to the event loop, which monitors the write socket and invokes the writer when it is possible to send more data."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/io_coroutine.rst:58
msgid "If the client has sent no data, ``read()`` returns an empty byte string to indicate that the connection is closed. The server needs to close the socket for writing to the client, and then the coroutine can return to indicate that it is finished."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/io_coroutine.rst:66
msgid "There are two steps to starting the server. First the application tells the event loop to create a new server object using the coroutine and the hostname and socket on which to listen. The ``start_server()`` method is itself a coroutine, so the results must be processed by the event loop in order to actually start the server. Completing the coroutine produces a ``asyncio.Server`` instance tied to the event loop."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/io_coroutine.rst:77
msgid "Then the event loop needs to be run in order to process events and handle client requests. For a long-running service, the ``run_forever()`` method is the simplest way to do this.  When the event loop is stopped, either by the application code or by signaling the process, the server can be closed to clean up the socket properly, and then the event loop can be closed to finish handling any other coroutines before the program exits."

msgid "Echo Client"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/io_coroutine.rst:91
msgid "Constructing a client using a coroutine is very similar to constructing a server.  The code again starts by importing the modules it needs to set up ``asyncio`` and :mod:`logging`, and then creating an event loop object."

msgid "asyncio_echo_client_coroutine.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/io_coroutine.rst:100
msgid "The ``echo_client`` coroutine takes arguments telling it where the server is and what messages to send."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/io_coroutine.rst:106
msgid "The coroutine is called when the task starts, but it has no active connection to work with. The first step, therefore, is to have the client establish its own connection. It uses ``await`` to avoid blocking other activity while the ``open_connection()`` coroutine runs."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/io_coroutine.rst:115
msgid "The ``open_connection()`` coroutine returns ``StreamReader`` and ``StreamWriter`` instances associated with the new socket. The next step is to use the writer to send data to the server. As in the server, the writer will buffer outgoing data until the socket is ready or ``drain()`` is used to flush the results. Since flushing network I/O can block, again ``await`` is used to restore control to the event loop, which monitors the write socket and invokes the writer when it is possible to send more data."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/io_coroutine.rst:127
msgid "Next the client looks for a response from the server by trying to read data until there is nothing left to read. To avoid blocking on an individual ``read()`` call, ``await`` yields control back to the event loop. If the server has sent data, it is logged. If the server has sent no data, ``read()`` returns an empty byte string to indicate that the connection is closed. The client needs to close the socket for sending to the server and then return to indicate that it is finished."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/io_coroutine.rst:139
msgid "To start the client, the event loop is called with the coroutine for creating the client. Using ``run_until_complete()`` avoids having an infinite loop in the client program. Unlike in the protocol example, no separate future is needed to signal when the coroutine is finished, because ``echo_client()`` contains all of the client logic itself and it does not return until it has received a response and closed the server connection."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/io_coroutine.rst:194
msgid "Although the client always sends the messages separately, the first two times the client runs the server receives one large message and echoes that back to the client. These results vary in subsequent runs, based on how busy the network is and whether the network buffers are flushed before all of the data is prepared."
