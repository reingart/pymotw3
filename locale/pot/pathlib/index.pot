msgid "``pathlib`` includes classes for managing filesystem paths formatted using either the POSIX standard or Microsoft Windows syntax. It includes so called \"pure\" classes, which operate on strings but do not interact with an actual filesystem, and \"concrete\" classes, which extend the API to include operations that reflect or modify data on the local filesystem."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/pathlib/index.rst:22
msgid "The pure classes ``PurePosixPath`` and ``PureWindowsPath`` can be instantiated and used on any operating system, since they only work on names. To instantiate the correct class for working with a real filesystem, use ``Path`` to get either a ``PosixPath`` or ``WindowsPath``, depending on the platform."

msgid "To instantiate a new path, give a string as the first argument. The string representation of the path object is this name value. To create a new path referring to a value relative to an existing path, use the ``/`` operator to extend the path. The argument to the operator can either be a string or another path object."

msgid "pathlib_operator.py"

#: ../../source/pathlib/index.rst:41
msgid "As the value for ``root`` in the example output shows, the operator combines the path values as they are given, and does not normalize the result when it contains the parent directory reference ``\"..\"``. However, if a segment begins with the path separator it is interpreted as a new \"root\" reference in the same way as ``os.path.join()``.  Extra path separators are removed from the middle of the path value, as in the ``etc`` example here."
msgstr ""

The ``parent`` property refers to a new path instance for the directory containing the path, the value returned by ``os.path.dirname()``.  The ``parents`` property is an iterable that produces parent directory references, continually going \"up\" the path hierarchy until reaching the root."
