msgid "The ``subprocess`` module supports three APIs for working with processes. The ``run()`` function, added in Python 3.5, is a high-level API for running a process and optionally collecting its output. The functions ``call()``, ``check_call()``, and ``check_output()`` are the former high-level API, carried over from Python 2. They are still supported and widely used in existing programs. The class ``Popen`` is a low-level API used to build the other APIs and useful for more complex process interactions. The constructor for ``Popen`` takes arguments to set up the new process so the parent can communicate with it via pipes.  It provides all of the functionality of the other modules and functions it replaces, and more. The API is consistent for all uses, and many of the extra steps of overhead needed (such as closing extra file descriptors and ensuring the pipes are closed) are \"built in\" instead of being handled by the application code separately."

#: ../../source/subprocess/index.rst:26
msgid "The ``subprocess`` module is intended to replace functions such as ``os.system()``, ``os.spawnv()``, the variations of ``popen()`` in the :mod:`os` and :mod:`popen2` modules, as well as the ``commands()`` module. To make it easier to compare ``subprocess`` with those other modules, many of the examples in this section re-create the ones used for :mod:`os` and :mod:`popen2`."

All child processes inherit their process group from their parent, and since it should only be set in the shell created by ``Popen`` and its descendants, ``os.setpgrp()`` should not be called in the same process where the ``Popen`` is created.  Instead, the function is passed to ``Popen`` as the ``preexec_fn`` argument so it is run after the ``fork()`` inside the new process, before it uses ``exec()`` to run the shell.
