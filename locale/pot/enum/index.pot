#: ../../source/enum/index.rst:8
msgid "The ``enum`` module defines an enumeration type with iteration and comparison capabilities. It can be used to create well-defined symbols for values, instead of using literal integers or strings."
msgstr ""

msgid "Creating Enumerations"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/enum/index.rst:15
msgid "A new enumeration is defined using the ``class`` syntax by subclassing ``Enum`` and adding class attributes describing the values."
msgstr ""

msgid "enum_create.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/enum/index.rst:22
msgid "The members of the ``Enum`` are converted to instances as the class is parsed. Each instance has a ``name`` property corresponding to the member name and a ``value`` property corresponding to the value assigned to the name in the class definition."

#: ../../source/enum/index.rst:44
msgid "Iterating over the enum *class* produces the individual members of the enumeration."

msgid "enum_iterate.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/enum/index.rst:51
msgid "The members are produced in the order they are declared in the class definition. The names and values are not used to sort them in any way."

msgid "Comparing Enums"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/enum/index.rst:75
msgid "Because enumeration members are not ordered, they support only comparison by identity and equality."
msgstr ""

msgid "enum_comparison.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/enum/index.rst:82
msgid "The greater-than and less-than comparison operators raise ``TypeError`` exceptions."

msgid "Use the ``IntEnum`` class for enumerations where the members need to behave more like numbers---for example, to support comparisons."

msgid "Unique Enumeration Values"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/enum/index.rst:129
msgid "Enum members with the same value are tracked as alias references to the same member object. Aliases do not cause repeated values to be present in the iterator for the ``Enum``."
msgstr ""

msgid "enum_aliases.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/enum/index.rst:137
msgid "Because ``by_design`` and ``closed`` are aliases for other members, they do not appear separately in the output when iterating over the ``Enum``. The canonical name for a member is the first name attached to the value."
msgstr ""

msgid "To require all members to have unique values, add the ``@unique`` decorator to the ``Enum``."

msgid "Creating Enumerations Programmatically"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/enum/index.rst:195
msgid "In some cases, it is more convenient to create enumerations programmatically, rather than hard-coding them in a class definition. For those situations, ``Enum`` also supports passing the member names and values to the class constructor."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/enum/index.rst:0
msgid "enum_programmatic_create.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/enum/index.rst:204
msgid "The ``value`` argument is the name of the enumeration, which is used to build the representation of members. The ``names`` argument lists the members of the enumeration. When a single string is passed, it is split on whitespace and commas, and the resulting tokens are used as names for the members, which are automatically assigned values starting with ``1``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/enum/index.rst:232
msgid "For more control over the values associated with members, the ``names`` string can be replaced with a sequence of two-part tuples or a dictionary mapping names to values."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/enum/index.rst:0
msgid "enum_programmatic_mapping.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/enum/index.rst:240
msgid "In this example, a list of two-part tuples is given instead of a single string containing only the member names. This makes it possible to reconstruct the ``BugStatus`` enumeration with the members in the same order as the version defined in ``enum_create.py``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Non-integer Member Values"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/enum/index.rst:267
msgid "Enum member values are not restricted to integers. In fact, any type of object can be associated with a member. If the value is a tuple, the members are passed as individual arguments to ``__init__()``."
msgstr ""

msgid "enum_tuple_values.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/enum/index.rst:275
msgid "In this example, each member value is a tuple containing the numerical ID (such as might be stored in a database) and a list of valid transitions away from the current state."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/enum/index.rst:294
msgid "For more complex cases, tuples might become unwieldy. Since member values can be any type of object, dictionaries can be used for cases where there are a lot of separate attributes to track for each enum value. Complex values are passed directly to ``__init__()`` as the only argument other than ``self``."
