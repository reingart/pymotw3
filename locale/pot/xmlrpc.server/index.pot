msgid "The ``xmlrpc.server`` module contains classes for creating cross-platform, language-independent servers using the XML-RPC protocol. Client libraries exist for many other languages besides Python, making XML-RPC an easy choice for building RPC-style services."

msgid "All of the examples provided here include a client module as well to interact with the demonstration server. To run the examples, use two separate shell windows, one for the server and one for the client."

msgid "A Simple Server"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/xmlrpc.server/index.rst:25
msgid "This simple server example exposes a single function that takes the name of a directory and returns the contents. The first step is to create the ``SimpleXMLRPCServer`` instance and tell it where to listen for incoming requests ('localhost' port 9000 in this case). Then a function is defined to be part of the service, and registered so the server knows how to call it. The final step is to put the server into an infinite loop receiving and responding to requests."

#: ../../source/xmlrpc.server/index.rst:52
msgid "The ``ServerProxy`` is connected to the server using its base URL, and then methods are called directly on the proxy. Each method invoked on the proxy is translated into a request to the server. The arguments are formatted using XML, and then sent to the server in a POST message. The server unpacks the XML and determines which function to call based on the method name invoked from the client. The arguments are passed to the function, and the return value is translated back to XML to be returned to the client."

msgid "Alternate API Names"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/xmlrpc.server/index.rst:99
msgid "Sometimes the function names used inside a module or library are not the names that should be used in the external API.  Names may change because a platform-specific implementation is loaded, the service API is built dynamically based on a configuration file, or real functions can be replaced with stubs for testing.  To register a function with an alternate name, pass the name as the second argument to ``register_function()``."

msgid "Dotted API Names"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/xmlrpc.server/index.rst:137
msgid "Individual functions can be registered with names that are not normally legal for Python identifiers. For example, a period (``.``) can be included in the names to separate the namespace in the service. The next example extends the \"directory\" service to add \"create\" and \"remove\" calls. All of the functions are registered using the prefix \"``dir.``\" so that the same server can provide other services using a different prefix. One other difference in this example is that some of the functions return ``None``, so the server has to be told to translate the ``None`` values to a nil value."

msgid "The ``public()`` method of ``MyService`` is marked as exposed to the XML-RPC service while ``private()`` is not. The ``_dispatch()`` method is invoked when the client tries to access a function that is part of ``MyService``. It first enforces the use of a prefix (\"``prefix.``\" in this case, but any string can be used).  Then it requires the function to have an attribute called ``exposed`` with a true value. The exposed flag is set on a function using a decorator for convenience. The following example includes a few sample client calls."

msgid "As with many network services, it is possible to query an XML-RPC server to ask it what methods it supports and learn how to use them. ``SimpleXMLRPCServer`` includes a set of public methods for performing this introspection. By default they are turned off, but can be enabled with ``register_introspection_functions()``.  Support for ``system.listMethods()`` and ``system.methodHelp()`` can be added to a service by defining ``_listMethods()`` and ``_methodHelp()`` on the service class."

Redefine ``_listMethods()`` to apply whatever rules are desired.  Similarly, for this basic example ``_methodHelp()`` returns the docstring of the function, but could be written to build a help string from another source."
