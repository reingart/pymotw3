msgid "The ``pprint`` module contains a \"pretty printer\" for producing aesthetically pleasing views of data structures.  The formatter produces representations of data structures that can be parsed correctly by the interpreter, and that are also easy for a human to read. The output is kept on a single line, if possible, and indented when split across multiple lines."
