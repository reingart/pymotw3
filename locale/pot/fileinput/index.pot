The inputs to the program are one or more m3u files listing the MP3 files to be distributed. The output is an RSS feed printed to the console. To process the input, the program needs to iterate over the list of filenames and"

msgid "The ``input()`` function takes as argument a list of filenames to examine. If the list is empty, the module reads data from standard input. The function returns an iterator that produces individual lines from the text files being processed.  The caller just needs to loop over each line, skipping blanks and comments, to find the references to MP3 files."
