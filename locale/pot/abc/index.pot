msgstr ""

#: ../../source/abc/index.rst:13
msgid "Abstract base classes are a form of interface checking more strict than individual ``hasattr()`` checks for particular methods.  By defining an abstract base class, a common API can be established for a set of subclasses.  This capability is especially useful in situations where someone less familiar with the source for an application is going to provide plug-in extensions, but can also help when working on a large team or with a large code-base where keeping track of all of the classes at the same time is difficult or not possible."

msgid "How ABCs Work"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/abc/index.rst:25
msgid "``abc`` works by marking methods of the base class as abstract, and then registering concrete classes as implementations of the abstract base.  If an application or library requires a particular API, ``issubclass()`` or ``isinstance()`` can be used to check an object against the abstract class."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/abc/index.rst:31
msgid "To start, define an abstract base class to represent the API of a set of plug-ins for saving and loading data.  Set the metaclass for the new base class to ``ABCMeta``, and use decorators to establish the public API for the class.  The following examples use ``abc_base.py``."

msgid "Registering a Concrete Class"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/abc/index.rst:45
msgid "There are two ways to indicate that a concrete class implements an abstract API: either explicitly register the class or create a new subclass directly from the abstract base.  Use the ``register()`` class method as a decorator on a concrete class to add it explicitly when the class provides the required API, but is not part of the inheritance tree of the abstract base class."

msgid "abc_register.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/abc/index.rst:56
msgid "In this example the ``RegisteredImplementation`` is derived from ``LocalBaseClass``, but is registered as implementing the ``PluginBase`` API so ``issubclass()`` and ``isinstance()`` treat it as though it is derived from ``PluginBase``."

#: ../../source/abc/index.rst:85
msgid "In this case, normal Python class management features are used to recognize ``SubclassImplementation`` as implementing the abstract ``PluginBase``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/abc/index.rst:102
msgid "A side effect of using direct subclassing is it is possible to find all of the implementations of a plug-in by asking the base class for the list of known classes derived from it (this is not an ``abc`` feature, all classes can do this)."

#: ../../source/abc/index.rst:190
msgid "Although a concrete class must provide implementations of all abstract methods, the abstract base class can also provide implementations that can be invoked via ``super()``.  This allows common logic to be reused by placing it in the base class, but forces subclasses to provide an overriding method with (potentially) custom logic."

msgid "abc_concrete_method.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/abc/index.rst:200
msgid "Since ``ABCWithConcreteImplementation()`` is an abstract base class, it is not possible to instantiate it to use it directly.  Subclasses *must* provide an override for ``retrieve_values()``, and in this case the concrete class sorts the data before returning it."
