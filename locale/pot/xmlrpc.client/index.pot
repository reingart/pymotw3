msgid "Other options are available to support alternate transport. Both HTTP and HTTPS are supported out of the box, both with basic authentication. To implement a new communication channel, only a new transport class is needed.  It could be an interesting exercise, for example, to implement XML-RPC over SMTP."

msgid "All values passed to the server are encoded and escaped automatically. However, some data types may contain characters that are not valid XML. For example, binary image data may include byte values in the ASCII control range 0 to 31.  To pass binary data, it is best to use the ``Binary`` class to encode it for transport."
