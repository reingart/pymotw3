msgid "Encryption secures messages so that they can be verified as accurate and protected from interception.  Python's cryptography support includes :mod:`hashlib` for generating signatures of message content using standard algorithms such as MD5 and SHA, and :mod:`hmac` for verifying that a message has not been altered in transmission."
