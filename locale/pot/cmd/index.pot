msgid "The ``cmd`` module contains one public class, ``Cmd``, designed to be used as a base class for interactive shells and other command interpreters. By default it uses :mod:`readline` for interactive prompt handling, command line editing, and command completion."

msgid "Processing Commands"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/cmd/index.rst:21
msgid "A command interpreter created with ``cmd`` uses a loop to read all lines from its input, parse them, and then dispatch the command to an appropriate *command handler*. Input lines are parsed into two parts: the command, and any other text on the line. If the user enters ``foo bar``, and the interpreter class includes a method named ``do_foo()``, it is called with ``\"bar\"`` as the only argument."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/cmd/index.rst:28
msgid "The end-of-file marker is dispatched to ``do_EOF()``. If a command handler returns a true value, the program will exit cleanly. So to give a clean way to exit the interpreter, make sure to implement ``do_EOF()`` and have it return True."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/cmd/index.rst:50
msgid "The first thing to notice is the command prompt, ``(Cmd)``. The prompt can be configured through the attribute ``prompt``. The prompt value is dynamic, and if a command handler changes the prompt attribute the new value is used to query for the next command."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/cmd/index.rst:65
msgid "The ``help`` command is built into ``Cmd``. With no arguments, ``help`` shows the list of commands available. If the input includes a command name, the output is more verbose and restricted to details of that command, when available."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/cmd/index.rst:70
msgid "If the command is ``greet``, ``do_greet()`` is invoked to handle it:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/cmd/index.rst:78
msgid "If the class does not include a specific handler for a command, the method ``default()`` is called with the entire input line as an argument. The built-in implementation of ``default()`` reports an error."

#: ../../source/cmd/index.rst:88
msgid "Since ``do_EOF()`` returns True, typing Ctrl-D causes the interpreter to exit."

msgid "The docstring added to ``do_greet()`` becomes the help text for the command:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/cmd/index.rst:128
msgid "The output shows one optional argument to ``greet``, ``person``. Although the argument is optional to the command, there is a distinction between the command and the callback method. The method always takes the argument, but sometimes the value is an empty string. It is left up to the command handler to determine if an empty argument is valid, or do any further parsing and processing of the command. In this example, if a person's name is provided then the greeting is personalized."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/cmd/index.rst:144
msgid "Whether an argument is given by the user or not, the value passed to the command handler does not include the command itself. That simplifies parsing in the command handler, especially if multiple arguments are needed."

msgid "Live Help"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/cmd/index.rst:152
msgid "In the previous example, the formatting of the help text leaves something to be desired. Since it comes from the docstring, it retains the indentation from the source file. The source could be changed to remove the extra white-space, but that would leave the application code looking poorly formatted. A better solution is to implement a help handler for the ``greet`` command, named ``help_greet()``. The help handler is called to produce help text for the named command."

msgid "It is up to the help handler to actually output the help message, and not simply return the help text for handling elsewhere."

msgid "Auto-Completion"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/cmd/index.rst:183
msgid "``Cmd`` includes support for command completion based on the names of the commands with handler methods. The user triggers completion by hitting the tab key at an input prompt. When multiple completions are possible, pressing tab twice prints a list of the options."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/cmd/index.rst:191
msgid "The GNU libraries needed for ``readline`` are not available on all platforms by default. In those cases, tab completion may not work. See :mod:`readline` for tips on installing the necessary libraries if your Python installation does not have them."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/cmd/index.rst:205
msgid "Once the command is known, argument completion is handled by methods with the prefix ``complete_``. This allows new completion handlers to assemble a list of possible completions using arbitrary criteria (i.e., querying a database or looking at a file or directory on the file system). In this case, the program has a hard-coded set of \"friends\" who receive a less formal greeting than named or anonymous strangers. A real program would probably save the list somewhere, and read it once then cache the contents to be scanned as needed."

msgid "Each iteration through ``cmdloop()`` calls ``onecmd()`` to dispatch the command to its handler. The actual input line is parsed with ``parseline()`` to create a tuple containing the command, and the remaining portion of the line."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/cmd/index.rst:261
msgid "If the line is empty, ``emptyline()`` is called. The default implementation runs the previous command again. If the line contains a command, first ``precmd()`` is called then the handler is looked up and invoked. If none is found, ``default()`` is called instead. Finally ``postcmd()`` is called."

msgid "In addition to the methods described earlier, there are several attributes for controlling command interpreters.  :attr:`prompt` can be set to a string to be printed each time the user is asked for a new command.  :attr:`intro` is the \"welcome\" message printed at the start of the program. ``cmdloop()`` takes an argument for this value, or it can be set on the class directly.  When printing help, the :attr:`doc_header`, :attr:`misc_header`, :attr:`undoc_header`, and :attr:`ruler` attributes are used to format the output."

#: ../../source/cmd/index.rst:330
msgid "To supplement the standard command processing, ``Cmd`` includes two special command prefixes. A question mark (``?``) is equivalent to the built-in ``help`` command, and can be used in the same way. An exclamation point (``!``) maps to ``do_shell()``, and is intended for \"shelling out\" to run other commands, as in this example."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/cmd/index.rst:397
msgid "To have the program read a script file directly, a few other changes may be needed. Since :mod:`readline` interacts with the terminal/tty device, rather than the standard input stream, it should be disabled when the script is going to be reading from a file. Also, to avoid printing superfluous prompts, the prompt can be set to an empty string. This example shows how to open a file and pass it as input to a modified version of the ``HelloWorld`` example."
