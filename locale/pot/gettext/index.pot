msgid "The ``gettext`` module provides a pure-Python implementation compatible with the GNU **gettext** library for message translation and catalog management.  The tools available with the Python source distribution enable you to extract messages from a set of source files, build a message catalog containing translations, and use that message catalog to display an appropriate message for the user at runtime."

msgid "Message catalogs can be used to provide internationalized interfaces for a program, showing messages in a language appropriate to the user. They can also be used for other message customizations, including \"skinning\" an interface for different wrappers or partners."

msgid "Although the standard library documentation says all of the necessary tools are included with Python, ``pygettext.py`` failed to extract messages wrapped in the ``ngettext`` call, even with the appropriate command line options. These examples use ``xgettext`` from the GNU **gettext** tool set, instead."

msgid "Creating Message Catalogs from Source Code"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/gettext/index.rst:78
msgid "``gettext`` works by looking up literal strings in a database of translations, and pulling out the appropriate translated string.  The usual pattern is to bind the appropriate lookup function to the name \"``_``\" (a single underscore character) so that the code is not cluttered with a lot of calls to functions with longer names."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/gettext/index.rst:84
msgid "The message extraction program, ``xgettext``, looks for messages embedded in calls to the catalog lookup functions.  It understands different source languages and uses an appropriate parser for each. If the lookup functions are aliased, or extra functions are added, give ``xgettext`` the names of additional symbols to consider when extracting messages."

msgid "Message catalogs are installed into directories organized by *domain* and *language*.  The domain is provided by the application or library, and is usually a unique value like the application name.  In this case, the domain in ``gettext_example.py`` is ``example_domain``.  The language value is provided by the user's environment at runtime, through one of the environment variables ``LANGUAGE``, ``LC_ALL``, ``LC_MESSAGES``, or ``LANG``, depending on their configuration and platform.  These examples were all run with the language set to ``en_US``."

#: ../../source/gettext/index.rst:144
msgid "Now that the template is ready, the next step is to create the required directory structure and copy the template in to the right spot.  The ``locale`` directory inside the PyMOTW source tree will serve as the root of the message catalog directory for these examples, but it is typically better to use a directory accessible system-wide so that all users have access to the message catalogs.  The full path to the catalog input source is ``$localedir/$language/LC_MESSAGES/$domain.po``, and the actual catalog has the filename extension ``.mo``."

msgid "As described earlier, the *locale directory* containing the message catalogs is organized based on the language with catalogs named for the *domain* of the program.  Different operating systems define their own default value, but ``gettext`` does not know all of these defaults.  It uses a default locale directory of ``sys.prefix + '/share/locale'``, but most of the time it is safer to always explicitly give a ``localedir`` value than to depend on this default being valid.  The ``find()`` function is responsible for locating an appropriate message catalog at runtime."

The first variable found to be set is used.  Multiple languages can be selected by separating the values with a colon (``:``).  To see how that works, use a second message catalog to run a few experiments."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/gettext/index.rst:301
msgid "While simple message substitution will handle most translation needs, ``gettext`` treats pluralization as a special case.  Depending on the language, the difference between the singular and plural forms of a message may vary only by the ending of a single word, or the entire sentence structure may be different.  There may also be different forms depending on the level of plurality.  To make managing plurals easier (and, in some cases, possible), there is a separate set of functions for asking for the plural form of a message."

msgid "plural.pot"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/gettext/index.rst:336
msgid "In addition to filling in the translation strings, the library needs to be told about the way plurals are formed so it knows how to index into the array for any given count value.  The line ``\"Plural-Forms: nplurals=INTEGER; plural=EXPRESSION;\\n\"`` includes two values to replace manually.  ``nplurals`` is an integer indicating the size of the array (the number of translations used) and ``plural`` is a C language expression for converting the incoming quantity to an index in the array when looking up the translation.  The literal string ``n`` is replaced with the quantity passed to ``ungettext()``."

Some situations, especially web applications, need to use different message catalogs at different times, without exiting and resetting the environment.  For those cases, the class-based API provided in ``gettext`` will be more convenient.  The API calls are essentially the same as the global calls described in this section, but the message catalog object is exposed and can be manipulated directly, so that multiple catalogs can be used."
