msgid "Programming using iterators occasionally requires creating small functions for simple expressions. Sometimes, these can be implemented as ``lambda`` functions, but for some operations new functions are not needed at all.  The ``operator`` module defines functions that correspond to built-in operations for arithmetic, comparison, and other operations corresponding to standard object APIs."

msgid "``not_()`` includes the trailing underscore because ``not`` is a Python keyword.  ``truth()`` applies the same logic used when testing an expression in an ``if`` statement or converting an expression to a ``bool``.  ``is_()`` implements the same check used by the ``is`` keyword, and ``is_not()`` does the same test and returns the opposite answer."

These are callable objects constructed at runtime to retrieve attributes of objects or contents from sequences.
