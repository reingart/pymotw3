msgid "Encode Python objects as JSON strings, and decode JSON strings into Python objects."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/json/index.rst:11
msgid "The ``json`` module provides an API similar to :mod:`pickle` for converting in-memory Python objects to a serialized representation known as JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).  Unlike pickle, JSON has the benefit of having implementations in many languages (especially JavaScript).  It is most widely used for communicating between the web server and client in a REST API, but is also useful for other inter-application communication needs."

msgid "Human-consumable vs. Compact Output"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/json/index.rst:74
msgid "Another benefit of JSON over :mod:`pickle` is that the results are human-readable.  The ``dumps()`` function accepts several arguments to make the output even nicer.  For example, the ``sort_keys`` flag tells the encoder to output the keys of a dictionary in sorted, instead of random, order."

msgid "json_sort_keys.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/json/index.rst:84
msgid "Sorting makes it easier to scan the results by eye, and also makes it possible to compare JSON output in tests."

msgid "For highly-nested data structures, specify a value for ``indent`` so the output is formatted nicely as well."

msgid "json_indent.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/json/index.rst:110
msgid "When indent is a non-negative integer, the output more closely resembles that of :mod:`pprint`, with leading spaces for each level of the data structure matching the indent level."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/json/index.rst:137
msgid "Verbose output like this increases the number of bytes needed to transmit the same amount of data, however, so it is not intended for use in a production environment.  In fact, it is possible to adjust the settings for separating data in the encoded output to make it even more compact than the default."

msgid "json_compact_encoding.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/json/index.rst:147
msgid "The ``separators`` argument to ``dumps()`` should be a tuple containing the strings to separate items in a list and keys from values in a dictionary.  The default is ``(', ', ': ')``. By removing the whitespace, a more compact output is produced."

msgid "Encoding Dictionaries"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/json/index.rst:171
msgid "The JSON format expects the keys to a dictionary to be strings. Trying to encode a dictionary with non-string types as keys produces a ``TypeError``. One way to work around that limitation is to tell the encoder to skip over non-string keys using the ``skipkeys`` argument:"

msgid "Working with Custom Types"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/json/index.rst:202
msgid "All of the examples so far have used Pythons built-in types because those are supported by ``json`` natively.  It is common to need to encode custom classes, as well, and there are two ways to do that."

msgid "json_myobj.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/json/index.rst:212
msgid "The simple way of encoding a ``MyObj`` instance is to define a function to convert an unknown type to a known type.  It does not need to do the encoding, so it should just convert one object to another."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/json/index.rst:0
msgid "json_dump_default.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/json/index.rst:220
msgid "In ``convert_to_builtin_type()``, instances of classes not recognized by ``json`` are converted to dictionaries with enough information to re-create the object if a program has access to the Python modules necessary."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/json/index.rst:244
msgid "To decode the results and create a ``MyObj()`` instance, use the ``object_hook`` argument to ``loads()`` to tie in to the decoder so the class can be imported from the module and used to create the instance."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/json/index.rst:249
msgid "The ``object_hook`` is called for each dictionary decoded from the incoming data stream, providing a chance to convert the dictionary to another type of object.  The hook function should return the object the calling application should receive instead of the dictionary."

msgid "json_load_object_hook.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/json/index.rst:258
msgid "Since ``json`` converts string values to unicode objects, they need to be re-encoded as ASCII strings before they can be used as keyword arguments to the class constructor."

msgid "Encoder and Decoder Classes"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/json/index.rst:284
msgid "Besides the convenience functions already covered, the ``json`` module provides classes for encoding and decoding.  Using the classes directly gives access to extra APIs for customizing their behavior."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/json/index.rst:288
msgid "The ``JSONEncoder`` uses an iterable interface for producing \"chunks\" of encoded data, making it easier to write to files or network sockets without having to represent an entire data structure in memory."
msgstr ""

msgid "json_encoder_iterable.py"

#: ../../source/json/index.rst:297
msgid "The output is generated in logical units, rather than being based on any size value."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/json/index.rst:386
msgid "All of the examples so far have assumed that the encoded version of the entire data structure could be held in memory at one time.  With large data structures, it may be preferable to write the encoding directly to a file-like object.  The convenience functions ``load()`` and ``dump()`` accept references to a file-like object to use for reading or writing."
