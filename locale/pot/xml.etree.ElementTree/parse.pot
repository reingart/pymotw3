The tree knows about all of the data in the input document, and the nodes of the tree can be searched or manipulated in place.  While this flexibility can make working with the parsed document more convenient, it typically takes more memory than an event-based parsing approach since the entire document must be loaded at one time."

The previous example had to look at each outline node to determine if it was a group (nodes with only a :attr:`text` attribute) or podcast (with both :attr:`text` and :attr:`xmlUrl`).

msgid "A potentially more efficient means of handling parse events is to replace the standard tree builder behavior with a custom version.  The ``XMLParser`` parser uses a ``TreeBuilder`` to process the XML and call methods on a target class to save the results.  The usual output is an ``ElementTree`` instance created by the default ``TreeBuilder`` class.  Replacing ``TreeBuilder`` with another class allows it to receive the events before the ``Element`` nodes are instantiated, saving that portion of the overhead."
