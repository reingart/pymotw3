msgid "Time the execution of small bits of Python code."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/timeit/index.rst:10
msgid "The ``timeit`` module provides a simple interface for determining the execution time of small bits of Python code. It uses a platform-specific time function to provide the most accurate time calculation possible and reduces the impact of start-up or shutdown costs on the time calculation by executing the code repeatedly."

msgid "Module Contents"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/timeit/index.rst:19
msgid "``timeit`` defines a single public class, ``Timer``. The constructor for ``Timer`` takes a statement to be timed and a \"setup\" statement (used to initialize variables, for example). The Python statements should be strings and can include embedded newlines."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/timeit/index.rst:24
msgid "The ``timeit()`` method runs the setup statement one time, then executes the primary statement repeatedly and returns the amount of time that passes. The argument to ``timeit()`` controls how many times to run the statement; the default is 1,000,000."
msgstr ""

msgid "Basic Example"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/timeit/index.rst:32
msgid "To illustrate how the various arguments to ``Timer`` are used, here is a simple example that prints an identifying value when each statement is executed."

#: ../../source/timeit/index.rst:40
msgid "When run, the output shows the results of the repeated calls to ``print()``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/timeit/index.rst:71
msgid "``timeit()`` runs the setup statement one time, then calls the main statement ``count`` times. It returns a single floating point value representing the cumulative amount of time spent running the main statement."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/timeit/index.rst:76
msgid "When ``repeat()`` is used, it calls ``timeit()`` several times (3 in this case) and all of the responses are returned in a list."
msgstr ""

msgid "Storing Values in a Dictionary"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/timeit/index.rst:83
msgid "This more complex example compares the amount of time it takes to populate a dictionary with a large number of values using a variety of methods. First, a few constants are needed to configure the ``Timer``.  The ``setup_statement`` variable initializes a list of tuples containing strings and integers that will be used by the main statements to build dictionaries using the strings as keys and storing the integers as the associated values."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/timeit/index.rst:94
msgid "A utility function, ``show_results()``, is defined to print the results in a useful format.  The ``timeit()`` method returns the amount of time it takes to execute the statement repeatedly. The output of ``show_results()`` converts that into the amount of time it takes per iteration, and then further reduces the value to the average amount of time it takes to store one item in the dictionary."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/timeit/index.rst:104
msgid "To establish a baseline, the first configuration tested uses ``__setitem__()``.  All of the other variations avoid overwriting values already in the dictionary, so this simple version should be the fastest."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/timeit/index.rst:109
msgid "The first argument to ``Timer`` is a multi-line string, with white space preserved to ensure that it parses correctly when run. The second argument is a constant established to initialize the list of values and the dictionary."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/timeit/index.rst:117
msgid "The next variation uses ``setdefault()`` to ensure that values already in the dictionary are not overwritten."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/timeit/index.rst:123
msgid "This method adds the value only if a ``KeyError`` exception is raised when looking for the existing value."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/timeit/index.rst:130
msgid "And the last method uses \"``in``\" to determine if a dictionary has a particular key."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/timeit/index.rst:136
msgid "When run, the script produces the following output."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/timeit/index.rst:156
msgid "Those times are for a MacMini, and will vary depending on what hardware is used and what other programs are running on the system. Experiment with the ``range_size`` and ``count`` variables, since different combinations will produce different results."

msgid "From the Command Line"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/timeit/index.rst:164
msgid "In addition to the programmatic interface, ``timeit`` provides a command line interface for testing modules without instrumentation."

msgid "To run the module, use the ``-m`` option to the Python interpreter to find the module and treat it as the main program:"

msgid "For example, to get help:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/timeit/index.rst:188
msgid "The ``statement`` argument works a little differently on the command line than the argument to ``Timer``.  Instead of using one long string, pass each line of the instructions as a separate command line argument. To indent lines (such as inside a loop), embed spaces in the string by enclosing it in quotes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/timeit/index.rst:210
msgid "It is also possible to define a function with more complex code, then call the function from the command line."
