msgstr ""

#: ../../source/struct/index.rst:17
msgid "A set of module-level functions is available for working with structured values, as well as the ``Struct`` class.  Format specifiers are converted from their string format to a compiled representation, similar to the way regular expressions are handled. The conversion takes some resources, so it is typically more efficient to do it once when creating a ``Struct`` instance and call methods on the instance instead of using the module-level functions. All of the following examples use the ``Struct`` class."

#: ../../source/struct/index.rst:29
msgid "Structs support *packing* data into strings, and *unpacking* data from strings using format specifiers made up of characters representing the type of the data and optional count and endianness indicators.  Refer to the standard library documentation for a complete list of the supported format specifiers."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/struct/index.rst:35
msgid "In this example, the specifier calls for an integer or long integer value, a two-byte string, and a floating-point number.  The spaces in the format specifier are included to separate the type indicators, and are ignored when the format is compiled."
