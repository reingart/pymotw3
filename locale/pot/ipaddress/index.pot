#: ../../source/ipaddress/index.rst:11
msgid "The ``ipaddress`` module includes classes for working with IPv4 and IPv6 network addresses. The classes support validation, finding addresses and hosts on a network, and other common operations."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/ipaddress/index.rst:16
msgid "Addresses"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/ipaddress/index.rst:18
msgid "The most basic object represents the network address itself. Pass a string, integer, or byte sequence to ``ip_address()`` to construct an address. The return value will be a ``IPv4Address`` or ``IPv6Address`` instance, depending on the type of address being used."
msgstr ""

msgid "ipaddress_addresses.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/ipaddress/index.rst:28
msgid "Both classes can provide various representations of the address for different purposes, as well as answer basic assertions such as whether the address is reserved for multicast communication or if it is on a private network."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/ipaddress/index.rst:57
msgid "Networks"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/ipaddress/index.rst:59
msgid "A network is defined by a range of addresses. It is usually expressed with a base address and a mask indicating which portions of the address represent the network, and which portions are remaining to represent addresses on that network. The mask can be expressed explicitly, or using a prefix length value as in the example below."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/ipaddress/index.rst:0
msgid "ipaddress_networks.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/ipaddress/index.rst:69
msgid "As with addresses, there are two network classes for IPv4 and IPv6 networks. Each class provides properties or methods for accessing values associated with the network such as the broadcast address and the addresses on the network available for hosts to use."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/ipaddress/index.rst:101
msgid "A network instance is iterable, and yields the addresses on the network."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/ipaddress/index.rst:0
msgid "ipaddress_network_iterate.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/ipaddress/index.rst:108
msgid "This example only prints a few of the addresses, because an IPv6 network can contain far more addresses than fit in the output."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/ipaddress/index.rst:132
msgid "Iterating over the network yields addresses, but not all of them are valid for hosts. For example, the base address of the network and the broadcast address are both included. To find the addresses that can be used by regular hosts on the network, use the ``hosts()`` method, which produces a generator."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/ipaddress/index.rst:0
msgid "ipaddress_network_iterate_hosts.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/ipaddress/index.rst:142
msgid "Comparing the output of this example with the previous example shows that the host addresses do not include the first values produced when iterating over the entire network."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/ipaddress/index.rst:167
msgid "In addition to the iterator protocol, networks support the ``in`` operator to determine if an address is part of a network."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/ipaddress/index.rst:0
msgid "ipaddress_network_membership.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/ipaddress/index.rst:174
msgid "The implementation of ``in`` uses the network mask to test the address, so it is much more efficient than expanding the full list of addresses on the network."
msgstr ""

msgid "Interfaces"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/ipaddress/index.rst:204
msgid "A network interface represents a specific address on a network and can be represented by a host address and a network prefix or netmask."

msgid "ipaddress_interfaces.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/ipaddress/index.rst:211
msgid "The interface object has properties to access the full network and address separately, as well as several different ways to express the interface and network mask."
