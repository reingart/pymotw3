msgid "``doctest`` tests source code by running examples embedded in the documentation and verifying that they produce the expected results. It works by parsing the help text to find examples, running them, then comparing the output text against the expected value.  Many developers find ``doctest`` easier to use than :mod:`unittest` because, in its simplest form, there is no API to learn before using it.  However, as the examples become more complex the lack of fixture management can make writing ``doctest`` tests more cumbersome than using :mod:`unittest`."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/doctest/index.rst:65
msgid "Examples cannot usually stand on their own as explanations of a function, so ``doctest`` also allows for surrounding text.  It looks for lines beginning with the interpreter prompt (``>>>``) to find the beginning of a test case, and the case is ended by a blank line or by the next interpreter prompt.  Intervening text is ignored, and can have any format as long as it does not look like a test case."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/doctest/index.rst:111
msgid "There are other cases where the exact output may not be predictable, but should still be testable.  For example, local date and time values and object ids change on every test run, the default precision used in the representation of floating point values depend on compiler options, and string representations of container objects like dictionaries may not be deterministic.  Although these conditions cannot be controlled, there are techniques for dealing with them."

The ``...`` replaces the memory address in the object id, so that portion of the expected value is ignored and the actual output matches and the test passes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/doctest/index.rst:201
msgid "There are cases where the unpredictable value cannot be ignored, because that would make the test incomplete or inaccurate.  For example, simple tests quickly become more complex when dealing with data types whose string representations are inconsistent.  The string form of a dictionary, for example, may change based on the order the keys are added."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/doctest/index.rst:233
msgid "The best way to deal with these potential discrepancies is to create tests that produce values that are not likely to change.  In the case of dictionaries and sets, that might mean looking for specific keys individually, generating a sorted list of the contents of the data structure, or comparing against a literal value for equality instead of depending on the string representation."

Whitespace cannot be added to the expected value where none exists in the output, but the length of the whitespace sequence and actual whitespace characters do not need to match.  The first test example gets this rule correct, and passes, even though there are extra spaces and newlines.  The second has extra whitespace after ``[`` and before ``]``, so it fails."

In this case, however, the tests are not defined in a Python module, and ``doctest`` does not know how to set up the global namespace, so the examples need to do the import work themselves.  All of the tests in a given file share the same execution context, so importing the module once at the top of the file is enough."
