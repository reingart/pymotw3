msgid "This is a simple example,. In fact, given the amount of data being manipulated, it might be faster to simply build the list and then sort it once. By contrast, for long lists, significant time and memory savings can be achieved using an insertion sort algorithm such as this, especially when the operation to compare two members of the list requires expensive computation."

#: ../../source/bisect/index.rst:65
msgid "The result set shown previously includes a repeated value, ``77``. The ``bisect`` module provides two ways to handle repeats: New values can be inserted either to the left of existing values, or to the right. The ``insort()`` function is actually an alias for ``insort_right()``, which inserts an item after the existing value. The corresponding function ``insort_left()`` inserts an item before the existing value."
