msgid "The ``io`` module implements the classes behind the interpreter's built-in ``open()`` for file-based input and output operations. The classes are decomposed in such a way that they can be recombined for alternate purposes, for example to enable writing Unicode data to a network socket."

msgid "In-memory Streams"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/io/index.rst:21
msgid "``StringIO`` provides a convenient means of working with text in memory using the file API (``read()``, ``write()``, etc.). Using :mod:`StringIO` to build large strings can offer performance savings over some other string concatenation techniques in some cases. In-memory stream buffers are also useful for testing, where writing to a real file on disk may slow down the test suite."

#: ../../source/io/index.rst:34
msgid "This example uses ``read()``, but the ``readline()`` and ``readlines()`` methods are also available. The ``StringIO`` class also provides a ``seek()`` method for jumping around in a buffer while reading, which can be useful for rewinding if a look-ahead parsing algorithm is being used."

msgid "Wrapping Byte Streams for Text Data"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/io/index.rst:79
msgid "Raw byte streams such as sockets can be wrapped with a layer to handle string encoding and decoding, making it easier to use them with text data. The ``TextIOWrapper`` class supports writing as well as reading.  The ``write_through`` argument disables buffering, and flushes all data written to the wrapper through to the underlying buffer immediately."
