The ``inspect`` module includes several such predicate functions with names like ``ismodule()``, ``isclass()``, etc."

msgid "In addition to introspection of code objects, ``inspect`` includes functions for inspecting the runtime environment while a program is being executed. Most of these functions work with the call stack, and operate on *call frames*. Frame objects hold the current execution context, including references to the code being run, the operation being executed, as well as the values of local and global variables. Typically such information is used to build tracebacks when exceptions are raised. It can also be useful for logging or when debugging programs, since the stack frames can be interrogated to discover the argument values passed into the functions."
