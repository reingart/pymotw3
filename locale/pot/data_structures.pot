msgid "Python includes several standard programming data structures, such as ``list``, ``tuple``, ``dict``, and ``set``, as part of its built-in types.  Many applications do not require other structures, but when they do, the standard library provides powerful and well-tested versions that are ready to be used."

msgid "The :mod:`enum` module provides an implementation of an *enumeration* type, with iteration and comparison capabilities. It can be used to create well-defined symbols for values, instead of using literal strings or integers."

# 6df211eb202240b18bb7d7cef2b9339d
msgid "The :mod:`collections` module includes implementations of several data structures that extend those found in other modules.  For example, ``Deque`` is a double-ended queue, which allows the addition or removal of items from either end.  The ``defaultdict`` is a dictionary that responds with a default value if a key is missing, while ``OrderedDict`` remembers the sequence in which items are added to it.  ``namedtuple`` extends the normal ``tuple`` to give each member item an attribute name in addition to a numeric index."

msgid "For large amounts of data, an :mod:`array` may make more efficient use of memory than a ``list``.  Since the ``array`` is limited to a single data type, it can use a more compact memory representation than a general-purpose ``list``.  At the same time, ``array`` instances can be manipulated using many of the same methods as a ``list``, so it may be possible to replace a ``list`` with an ``array`` in an application without a lot of other changes."

# 3d6f1a95609048ca96fd323bb073539a
msgid "Sorting items in a sequence is a fundamental aspect of data manipulation.  Python's ``list`` includes a ``sort()`` method, but sometimes it is more efficient to maintain a list in sorted order without re-sorting it each time its contents are changed.  The functions in :mod:`heapq` modify the contents of a list while preserving the sort order of the list with low overhead."

# f617b3a515244e77a47069033249bdbd
msgid "Another option for building sorted lists or arrays is :mod:`bisect`. It uses a binary search to find the insertion point for new items, and is an alternative to repeatedly sorting a list that changes frequently."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/data_structures.rst:47
# 281983c2f9ab414abf4ac9a6e8aefa3f
msgid "Although the built-in ``list`` can simulate a queue using the ``insert()`` and ``pop()`` methods, it is not thread-safe.  For true ordered communication between threads use the :mod:`queue` module.  :mod:`multiprocessing` includes a version of a ``Queue`` that works between processes, making it easier to convert a multithreaded program to use processes instead."

msgid ":mod:`struct` is useful for decoding data from another application, perhaps coming from a binary file or stream of data, into Python's native types for easier manipulation."

# c29ae74f599d42d2b1cc591eb1d33f64
msgid "This chapter covers two modules related to memory management.  For highly interconnected data structures, such as graphs and trees, use :mod:`weakref` to maintain references while still allowing the garbage collector to clean up objects after they are no longer needed.  Use the functions in :mod:`copy` for duplicating data structures and their contents, including making recursive copies with ``deepcopy()``."

# 7058752ba92c414f80f5a46f4dc6bff1
msgid "Debugging data structures can be time consuming, especially when wading through printed output of large sequences or dictionaries.  Use :mod:`pprint` to create easy-to-read representations that can be printed to the console or written to a log file for easier debugging."

msgid "Finally, if the available types do not meet the requirements, subclass one of the native types and customize it, or build a new container type using one of the abstract base classes defined in :mod:`collections` as a starting point."
