msgid "The primary tool supplied by the ``functools`` module is the class ``partial``, which can be used to \"wrap\" a callable object with default arguments. The resulting object is itself callable and can be treated as though it is the original function.  It takes all of the same arguments as the original, and can be invoked with extra positional or named arguments as well.  A ``partial`` can be used instead of a ``lambda`` to provide default arguments to a function, while leaving some arguments unspecified."

#: ../../source/functools/index.rst:267
msgid "Under Python 2, classes could define a ``__cmp__()`` method that returns ``-1``, ``0``, or ``1`` based on whether the object is less than, equal to, or greater than the item being compared.  Python 2.1 introduced the *rich comparison* methods API (``__lt__()``, ``__le__()``, ``__eq__()``, ``__ne__()``, ``__gt__()``, and ``__ge__()``), which perform a single comparison operation and return a boolean value.  Python 3 deprecated ``__cmp__()`` in favor of these new methods and ``functools`` provides tools to make it easier to write classes that comply with the new comparison requirements in Python 3."

msgid "Rich Comparison"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/functools/index.rst:281
msgid "The rich comparison API is designed to allow classes with complex comparisons to implement each test in the most efficient way possible. However, for classes where comparison is relatively simple, there is no point in manually creating each of the rich comparison methods. The ``total_ordering()`` class decorator takes a class that provides some of the methods, and adds the rest of them."

msgid "The class must provide implementation of ``__eq__()`` and one other rich comparison method.  The decorator adds implementations of the rest of the methods that work by using the comparisons provided. If a comparison cannot be made, the method should return ``NotImplemented`` so the comparison can be tried using the reverse comparison operators on the other object, before failing entirely."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/functools/index.rst:360
msgid "The output shows that ``sorted()`` starts by calling ``get_key_wrapper()`` for each item in the sequence to produce a key.  The keys returned by ``cmp_to_key()`` are instances of a class defined in ``functools`` that implements the rich comparison API using the old-style comparison function passed in.  After all of the keys are created, the sequence is sorted by comparing the keys."

msgid "The ``lru_cache()`` decorator wraps a function in a least-recently-used cache. Arguments to the function are used to build a hash key, which is then mapped to the result. Subsequent calls with the same arguments will fetch the value from the cache instead of calling the function. The decorator also adds methods to the function to examine the state of the cache (``cache_info()``) and empty the cache (``cache_clear()``)."

msgid "functools_reduce_short_sequences.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/functools/index.rst:584
msgid "Because the initializer argument serves as a default, but is also combined with the new values if the input sequence is not empty, it is important to consider carefully whether to use it. When it does not make sense to combine the default with new values, it is better to catch the ``TypeError`` rather than passing an initializer."

#: ../../source/functools/index.rst:609
msgid "In a dynamically typed language like Python it is common to need to perform slightly different operation based on the type of an argument, especially when dealing with the difference between a list of items and a single item. It is simple enough to check the type of an argument directly, but in cases where the behavioral difference can be isolated into separate functions ``functools`` provides the ``singledispatch()`` decorator to register a set of *generic functions* for automatic switching based on the type of the first argument to a function."
