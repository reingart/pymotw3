msgid ""
"The ``ChainMap`` class manages a sequence of dictionaries, and searches "
"through them in the order they are given to find values associated with "
"keys. A ``ChainMap`` makes a good \"context\" container, since it can be "
"treated as a stack for which changes happen as the stack grows, with "
"these changes being discarded again as the stack shrinks."

"The child mappings are searched in the order they are passed to the "
"constructor, so the value reported for the key ``'c'`` comes from the "

msgid "Reordering"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/collections/chainmap.rst:53
msgid ""
"The ``ChainMap`` stores the list of mappings over which it searches in a "
"list in its :attr:`maps` attribute. This list is mutable, so it is "
"possible to add new mappings directly or to change the order of the "
"elements to control lookup and update behavior."

"A ``ChainMap`` does not cache the values in the child mappings. Thus, if "

"It is also possible to set values through the ``ChainMap`` directly, "
"although only the first mapping in the chain is actually modified."

"``ChainMap`` provides a convenience method for creating a new instance "
"with one extra mapping at the front of the :attr:`maps` list to make it "
"easy to avoid modifying the existing underlying data structures."

"This stacking behavior is what makes it convenient to use ``ChainMap`` "
"instances as template or application contexts. Specifically, it is easy "
"to add or update values in one iteration, then discard the changes for "
"the next iteration."

"For situations where the new context is known or built in advance, it is "
