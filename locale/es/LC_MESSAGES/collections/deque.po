msgid "deque --- Double-Ended Queue"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/collections/deque.rst:7
msgid ""
"A double-ended queue, or ``deque``, supports adding and removing elements"
" from either end of the queue. The more commonly used stacks and queues "
"are degenerate forms of deques, where the inputs and outputs are "
"restricted to a single end."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/collections/deque.rst
msgid "collections_deque.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/collections/deque.rst:16
msgid ""
"Since deques are a type of sequence container, they support some of the "
"same operations as ``list``, such as examining the contents with "
"``__getitem__()``, determining length, and removing elements from the "
"middle of the queue by matching identity."

msgid "Populating"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/collections/deque.rst:40
msgid ""
"A deque can be populated from either end, termed \"left\" and \"right\" "
"in the Python implementation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/collections/deque.rst
msgid "collections_deque_populating.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/collections/deque.rst:47
msgid ""
"The ``extendleft()`` function iterates over its input and performs the "
"equivalent of an ``appendleft()`` for each item. The end result is that "
"the ``deque`` contains the input sequence in reverse order."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/collections/deque.rst:67
msgid "Consuming"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/collections/deque.rst:69
msgid ""
"Similarly, the elements of the ``deque`` can be consumed from both ends "
"or either end, depending on the algorithm being applied."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/collections/deque.rst
msgid "collections_deque_consuming.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/collections/deque.rst:76
msgid ""
"Use ``pop()`` to remove an item from the \"right\" end of the ``deque`` "
"and ``popleft()`` to take an item from the \"left\" end."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/collections/deque.rst:95
msgid ""
"Since deques are thread-safe, the contents can even be consumed from both"
" ends at the same time from separate threads."
msgstr ""

msgid "collections_deque_both_ends.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/collections/deque.rst:102
msgid ""
"The threads in this example alternate between each end, removing items "
"until the ``deque`` is empty."
msgstr ""

msgid "Rotating"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/collections/deque.rst:123
msgid ""
"Another useful aspect of the ``deque`` is the ability to rotate it in "
"either direction, so as to skip over some items."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/collections/deque.rst
msgid "collections_deque_rotate.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/collections/deque.rst:130
msgid ""
"Rotating the ``deque`` to the right (using a positive rotation) takes "
"items from the right end and moves them to the left end. Rotating to the "
"left (with a negative value) takes items from the left end and moves them"
" to the right end.  It may help to visualize the items in the deque as "
"being engraved along the edge of a dial."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/collections/deque.rst:151
msgid "Constraining the Queue Size"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/collections/deque.rst:153
msgid ""
"A ``deque`` instance can be configured with a maximum length so that it "
"never grows beyond that size. When the queue reaches the specified "
"length, existing items are discarded as new items are added. This "
"behavior is useful for finding the last *n* items in a stream of "
"undetermined length."
