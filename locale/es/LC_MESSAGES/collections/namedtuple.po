"``namedtuple`` instances are just as memory efficient as regular tuples "
"because they do not have per-instance dictionaries.  Each kind of "
"``namedtuple`` is represented by its own class, which is created by using"
" the ``namedtuple()`` factory function.  The arguments are the name of "
"the new class and a string containing the names of the elements."

"``namedtuple`` provides several useful attributes and methods for working"

"names prefixed with an underscore (``_``), which by convention in most "
"Python programs indicates a private attribute. For ``namedtuple``, "

"user-provided attribute names."
