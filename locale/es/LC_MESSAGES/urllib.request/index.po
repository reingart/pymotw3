"The ``urllib.request`` module provides an API for using Internet "

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/urllib.request/index.rst:178
msgid ""
"``urlopen()`` is a convenience function that hides some of the details of"
" how the request is made and handled. More precise control is possible by"
" using a ``Request`` instance directly.  For example, custom headers can "
"be added to the outgoing request to control the format of data returned, "
"specify the version of a document cached locally, and tell the remote "
"server the name of the software client communicating with it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As the output from the earlier examples shows, the default *User-agent* "
"header value is made up of the constant ``Python-urllib``, followed by "
"the Python interpreter version. When creating an application that will "
"access web resources owned by someone else, it is courteous to include "
"real user agent information in the requests, so they can identify the "
"source of the hits more easily. Using a custom agent also allows them to "
"control crawlers using a ``robots.txt`` file (see the "
":mod:`http.robotparser` module)."

"``urllib.request`` has built-in support for HTTP(S), FTP, and local file "
"access. To add support for other URL types, register another protocol "
"handler. For example, to support URLs pointing to arbitrary files on "
"remote NFS servers, without requiring users to mount the path before "
"accessing the file, create a class derived from ``BaseHandler`` and with "
"a method ``nfs_open()``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The protocol-specific ``open()`` method is given a single argument, the "
"``Request`` instance, and it should return an object with a ``read()`` "
"method that can be used to read the data, an ``info()`` method to return "
"the response headers, and ``geturl()`` to return the actual URL of the "
"file being read. A simple way to achieve that is to create an instance of"
" ``urllib.response.addinfourl``, passing the headers, URL, and open file "
