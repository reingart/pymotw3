"Although Python is often used as a cross-platform language, it is "
"occasionally necessary to know what sort of system a program is running "
"on. Build tools need that information, but an application might also know"
" that some of the libraries or external commands it uses have different "
"interfaces on different operating systems. For example, a tool to manage "
"the network configuration of an operating system can define a portable "
"representation of network interfaces, aliases, IP addresses, etc. But "
"when the time comes to edit the configuration files, it must know more "
"about the host so it can use the correct operating system configuration "
"commands and files.  The ``platform`` module includes the tools for "
"learning about the interpreter, operating system, and hardware platform "
"where a program is running."

"The example output in this section was generated on three systems: a Mac "
"mini running OS X 10.11.6, a Dell PC running Ubuntu Linux 14.04, and a "
"VirtualBox VM running Windows 10.  Python was installed on the OS X and "
"Windows systems using the pre-compiled installers from python.org. The "
"Linux system is running a version in a system package."

"level components. ``python_compiler()`` reports on the compiler used to "
"build the interpreter. And ``python_build()`` gives a version string for "
"the build of the interpreter."
