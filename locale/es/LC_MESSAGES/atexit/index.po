"It is also possible to register more than one function and to pass "
"arguments to the registered functions.  That can be useful to cleanly "
"disconnect from databases, remove temporary files, etc.  Instead of "
"keeping a list of resources that need to be freed, a separate clean-up "
"function can be registered for each resource."

"The exit functions are called in the reverse of the order in which they "
"are registered. This method allows modules to be cleaned up in the "
"reverse order from which they are imported (and therefore register their "
"``atexit`` functions), which should reduce dependency conflicts."

"Because the function is registered as it is defined, it is also important"
" to ensure that it works properly even if no other work is performed by "
"the module. If the resources it is supposed to clean up were never "
"initialized, calling the exit callback should not produce an error."
