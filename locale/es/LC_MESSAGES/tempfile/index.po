"Creating temporary files with unique names securely, so they cannot be "
"guessed by someone wanting to break the application or steal the data, is"
" challenging. The ``tempfile`` module provides several functions for "
"creating temporary file system resources securely. ``TemporaryFile()`` "
"opens and returns an unnamed file, ``NamedTemporaryFile()`` opens and "
"returns a named file, ``SpooledTemporaryFile`` holds its content in "
"memory before writing to disk, and ``TemporaryDirectory`` is a context "
"manager that removes the directory when the context is closed."

"Applications that need temporary files to store data, without needing to "
"share that file with other programs, should use the ``TemporaryFile()`` "
"function to create the files. The function creates a file, and on "
"platforms where it is possible, unlinks it immediately. This makes it "
"impossible for another program to find or open the file, since there is "
"no reference to it in the file system table. The file created by "
"``TemporaryFile()`` is removed automatically when it is closed, whether "
"by calling ``close()`` or by using the context manager API and ``with`` "
"statement."

"This example illustrates the difference in creating a temporary file "

"There are situations where having a named temporary file is important. "
"For applications spanning multiple processes, or even hosts, naming the "
"file is the simplest way to pass it between parts of the application. The"
" ``NamedTemporaryFile()`` function creates a file without unlinking it, "

msgid ""
"For temporary files containing relatively small amounts of data, it is "
"likely to be more efficient to use a ``SpooledTemporaryFile`` because it "
"holds the file contents in memory using a ``io.BytesIO`` or "
"``io.StringIO`` buffer until they reach a threshold size. When the amount"
" of data passes the threshold, it is \"rolled over\" and written to disk,"
" and then the buffer is replaced with a normal ``TemporaryFile()``."

msgid "tempfile_SpooledTemporaryFile.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/tempfile/index.rst:156

"This example uses private attributes of the ``SpooledTemporaryFile`` to "
"determine when the rollover to disk has happened. It is not normally "
"necessary to check this status except when tuning the buffer size."
