"Retrieve lines of text from files or imported Python modules, holding a "
"cache of the results to make reading many lines from the same file more "
"efficient."

msgid ""
"The ``linecache`` module is used within other parts of the Python "
"standard library when dealing with Python source files. The "
"implementation of the cache holds the contents of files, parsed into "
"separate lines, in memory. The API returns the requested line(s) by "
"indexing into a ``list``, and saves time over repeatedly reading the file"
" and parsing lines to find the one desired. This is especially useful "
"when looking for multiple lines from the same file, such as when "
"producing a traceback for an error report."
