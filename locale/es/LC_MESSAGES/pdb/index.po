"Debugging a program involves a lot of repetition: running the code, "
"observing the output, adjusting the code or inputs, and running it again."
"  ``pdb`` attempts to cut down on the amount of repetition needed to "
"control the debugging experience, to let you concentrate on the code "
"instead of the debugger.  To help reduce the number of times you issue "
"the same commands to the debugger, ``pdb`` can read a saved configuration"
" from text files interpreted as it starts."
