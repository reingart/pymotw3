"``pyclbr`` can scan Python source to find classes and stand-alone "

"line numbers is gathered using :mod:`tokenize` *without* importing the "

"There are two public functions exposed by ``pyclbr``.  The first, "
"``readmodule()``, takes the name of the module as argument returns a "

"The metadata for the class includes the file and line number where it is "
"defined, as well as the names of super classes.  The methods of the class"
" are saved as a mapping between method name and line number.  The output "
