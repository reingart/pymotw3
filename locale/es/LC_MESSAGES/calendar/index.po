"The ``calendar`` module defines the ``Calendar`` class, which "
"encapsulates calculations for values such as the dates of the weeks in a "
"given month or year. In addition, the ``TextCalendar`` and "
"``HTMLCalendar`` classes can produce pre-formatted output."

"A similar HTML table can be produced with ``HTMLCalendar`` and "
"``formatmonth()``.  The rendered output looks roughly the same as the "
"plain text version, but is wrapped with HTML tags.  Each table cell has a"
" class attribute corresponding to the day of the week, so the HTML can be"
" styled through CSS."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/calendar/index.rst:58

"To produce output in a format other than one of the available defaults, "
"use ``calendar`` to calculate the dates and organize the values into week"
" and month ranges, then iterate over the result.  The ``weekheader()``, "
"``monthcalendar()``, and ``yeardays2calendar()`` methods of ``Calendar`` "
"are especially useful for that."

"Calling ``yeardays2calendar()`` produces a sequence of \"month row\" "

"Although the calendar module focuses mostly on printing full calendars in"

"The first day of the week defaults to Monday. It is possible to change "

"To calculate the group meeting dates for a year, assuming they are always"
