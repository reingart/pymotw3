"The ``warnings`` module was introduced by :pep:`230` as a way to warn "
"programmers about changes in language or library features in anticipation"
" of backwards incompatible changes coming with Python 3.0. It can also be"
" used to report recoverable configuration errors or feature degradation "
"from missing libraries.  It is better to deliver user-facing messages via"
" the :mod:`logging` module, though, because warnings sent to the console "
"may be lost."

#: ../../source/warnings/index.rst:18
msgid ""
"Since warnings are not fatal, a program may encounter the same warn-able "
"situation many times in the course of running. The ``warnings`` module "
"suppresses repeated messages from the same source to cut down on the "
"annoyance of seeing the same warning over and over.  The output can be "
"controlled on a case-by-case basis, using the command line options to the"
" interpreter or by calling functions found in ``warnings``."

"Warnings are categorized using subclasses of the built-in exception class"
" ``Warning``. Several standard values are described in the online "
"documentation for the :mod:`exceptions` module, and custom warnings can "
"be added by subclassing from ``Warning``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/warnings/index.rst:34
msgid ""
"Warnings are processed based on *filter* settings.  A filter consists of "
"five parts: the ``action``, ``message``, ``category``, ``module``, and "
"``line number``.  The ``message`` portion of the filter is a regular "
"expression that is used to match the warning text.  The ``category`` is a"
" name of an exception class.  The ``module`` contains a regular "
"expression to be matched against the module name generating the warning."
"  And the ``line number`` can be used to change the handling on specific "
"occurrences of a warning."

"When a warning is generated, it is compared against all of the registered"

"Filter Actions`."
