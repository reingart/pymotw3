"It is easy use ``trace`` directly from the command line.  The statements "
"being executed as the program runs are printed when the ``--trace`` "
"option is given. This example also ignores the location of the Python "
"standard library to avoid tracing into :mod:`importlib` and other modules"
" that might be more interesting in another example, but that clutter up "
"the output in this simple example."

"The first part of the output shows the setup operations performed by "
"``trace``.  The rest of the output shows the entry into each function, "
"including the module where the function is located, and then the lines of"
" the source file as they are executed.  ``recurse()`` is entered three "
"times, as expected based on the way it is called in ``main()``."

"Running ``trace`` from the command line with the ``--count`` option will "
"produce code coverage report information, detailing which lines are run "
"and which are skipped.  Since a complex program is usually made up of "
"multiple files, a separate coverage report is produced for each.  By "
"default the coverage report files are written to the same directory as "
"the module, named after the module but with a ``.cover`` extension "
"instead of ``.py``."

"Although the line ``def recurse(level):`` has a count of ``1``, that does"

"It is also possible to run the program several times, perhaps with "
"different options, to save the coverage data and produce a combined "

"only 87% covered.  Looking at the cover file for ``recurse`` shows that "
"the body of ``not_called`` is indeed never run, indicated by the "
