"As a general purpose programming language, Python is frequently used to "
"solve mathematical problems.  It includes built-in types for managing "
"integer and floating point numbers, which are suitable for the basic math"
" that might appear in an average application.  The standard library "
"includes modules for more advanced needs."

"Python's built-in floating point numbers use the underlying ``double`` "
"representation.  They are sufficiently precise for most programs with "
"mathematical requirements, but when more accurate representations of non-"
"integer values are needed the :mod:`decimal` and :mod:`fractions` modules"
" will be useful.  Arithmetic with decimal and fractional values retains "
"precision, but is not as fast as the native ``float``."

"The :mod:`random` module includes a uniform distribution pseudorandom "
"number generator, as well as functions for simulating many common non-"
"uniform distributions."

"The :mod:`math` module contains fast implementations of advanced "
"mathematical functions such as logarithms and trigonometric functions.  "
"The full complement of IEEE functions usually found in the native "
"platform C libraries is available through the module."
