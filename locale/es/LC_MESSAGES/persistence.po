"There are two aspects to preserving data for long-term use: converting "
"the data back and forth between the object in-memory and the storage "
"format, and working with the storage of the converted data.  The standard"
" library includes a variety of modules that handle both aspects in "
"different situations."

"Two modules convert objects into a format that can be transmitted or "
"stored (a process known as *serializing*).  It is most common to use "
":mod:`pickle` for persistence, since it is integrated with some of the "
"other standard library modules that actually store the serialized data, "
"such as ``shelve``.  ``json`` is more frequently used for web-based "
"applications, however, since it integrates better with existing web "
"service storage tools."

"Once the in-memory object is converted to a format that can be saved, the"
" next step is to decide how to store the data.  A simple flat-file with "
"serialized objects written one after the other works for data that does "
"not need to be indexed in any way.  Python includes a collection of "
"modules for storing key-value pairs in a simple database using one of the"
" DBM format variants when an indexed lookup is needed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/persistence.rst:28
msgid ""
"The most straightforward way to take advantage of the DBM format is "
":mod:`shelve`.  Open the shelve file, and access it through a dictionary-"
"like API.  Objects saved to the database are automatically pickled and "
"saved without any extra work by the caller."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/persistence.rst:33
msgid ""
"One drawback of ``shelve``, though, is that when using the default "
"interface there is no way to predict which DBM format will be used, since"
" it selects one based on the libraries available on the system where the "
"database is created.  The format does not matter if an application will "
"not need to share the database files between hosts with different "
"libraries, but if portability is a requirement, use one of the classes in"
" the module to ensure a specific format is selected."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/persistence.rst:41
msgid ""
"For web applications that work with data in JSON already, using "
":mod:`json` and :mod:`dbm` provides another persistence mechanism. Using "
":mod:`dbm` directly is a little more work than ``shelve`` because the DBM"
" database keys and values must be strings, and the objects will not be "
"re-created automatically when the value is accessed in the database."

"The :mod:`sqlite3` in-process relational database is available with most "
"Python distributions for storing data in more complex arrangements than "
"key/value pairs.  It stores its database in memory or in a local file, "
"and all access is from within the same process so there is no network "
"communication lag.  The compact nature of ``sqlite3`` makes it especially"
" well suited for embedding in desktop applications or development "
"versions of web apps."

#: ../../source/persistence.rst:56

"There are also modules for parsing more formally defined formats, useful "
"for exchanging data between Python programs and applications written in "
"other languages.  :mod:`xml.etree.ElementTree` can parse XML documents, "
"and provides several operating modes for different applications.  Besides"
" the parsing tools, ``ElementTree`` includes an interface for creating "
"well-formed XML documents from objects in memory.  The :mod:`csv` module "
"can read and write tabular data in formats produced by spreadsheets or "
"database applications, making it useful for bulk loading data, or "
"converting the data from one format to another."
