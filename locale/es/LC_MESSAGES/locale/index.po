"The ``locale`` module is part of Python's internationalization and "
"localization support library. It provides a standard way to handle "
"operations that may depend on the language or location of a user. For "
"example, it handles formatting numbers as currency, comparing strings for"
" sorting, and working with dates. It does not cover translation (see the "
":mod:`gettext` module) or Unicode encoding (see the :mod:`codecs` "
"module)."

"Changing the locale can have application-wide ramifications, so the "
"recommended practice is to avoid changing the value in a library and to "
"let the application set it one time. In the examples in this section, the"
" locale is changed several times within a short program to highlight the "
"differences in the settings of various locales. It is far more likely "
"that an application will set the locale once as it starts up or when a "
"web request is received and not change it."

"This section covers some of the high-level functions in the ``locale`` "

"The most common way to let the user change the locale settings for an "
"application is through an environment variable (``LC_ALL``, ``LC_CTYPE``,"
" ``LANG``, or ``LANGUAGE``, depending on the platform). The application "
"then calls ``setlocale()`` without a hard-coded value, and the "
"environment value is used."
