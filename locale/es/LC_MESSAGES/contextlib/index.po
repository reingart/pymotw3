"A *context manager* is responsible for a resource within a code block, "

"A context manager is enabled by the ``with`` statement, and the API "
"involves two methods.  The ``__enter__()`` method is run when execution "
"flow enters the code block inside the ``with``.  It returns an object to "
"be used within the context.  When execution flow leaves the ``with`` "
"block, the ``__exit__()`` method of the context manager is called to "
"clean up any resources being used."

"Creating context managers the traditional way, by writing a class with "

"Most context managers operate on one object at a time, such as a single "

" more dynamic cases."
msgstr ""

"An ``ExitStack`` instance maintains a stack data structure of cleanup "

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/contextlib/index.rst:445
msgid ""
"The context managers given to ``ExitStack`` are treated as though they "

msgid ""
"The examples using these classes are based around ``variable_stack()``, "

" the normal case of no exceptions."

"Sometimes when building complex contexts it is useful to be able to abort"

"delay the cleanup of all resources until a later time if they can all be "
"set up properly. For example, if an operation needs several long-lived "
"network connections, it may be best to not start the operation if one "
"connection fails. However, if all of the connections can be opened they "
