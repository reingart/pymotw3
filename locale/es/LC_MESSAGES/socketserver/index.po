msgid ""
"The ``socketserver`` module is a framework for creating network servers. "
"It defines classes for handling synchronous network requests (the server "
"request handler blocks until the request is completed) over TCP, UDP, "
"Unix streams, and Unix datagrams. It also provides mix-in classes for "
"easily converting servers to use a separate thread or process for each "
"request."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/socketserver/index.rst:17
msgid ""
"Responsibility for processing a request is split between a server class "
"and a request handler class. The server deals with the communication "
"issues, such as listening on a socket and accepting connections, and the "
"request handler deals with the \"protocol\" issues like interpreting "
"incoming data, processing it, and sending data back to the client. This "
"division of responsibility means that many applications can use one of "
"the existing server classes without any modifications, and provide a "
"request handler class for it to work with the custom protocol."

#: ../../source/socketserver/index.rst:30
msgid ""
"There are five different server classes defined in ``socketserver``.  "
"``BaseServer`` defines the API, and is not intended to be instantiated "
"and used directly. ``TCPServer`` uses TCP/IP sockets to communicate. "
"``UDPServer`` uses datagram sockets. ``UnixStreamServer`` and "
"``UnixDatagramServer`` use Unix-domain sockets and are only available on "
"Unix platforms."

msgid "Server Objects"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/socketserver/index.rst:40
msgid ""
"To construct a server, pass it an address on which to listen for requests"
" and a request handler *class* (not instance). The address format depends"
" on the server type and the socket family used. Refer to the "
":mod:`socket` module documentation for details."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/socketserver/index.rst:45
msgid ""
"Once the server object is instantiated, use either ``handle_request()`` "
"or ``serve_forever()`` to process requests. The ``serve_forever()`` "
"method calls ``handle_request()`` in an infinite loop, but if an "
"application needs to integrate the server with another event loop or use "
"``select()`` to monitor several sockets for different servers, it can "
"call ``handle_request()`` directly."

msgid "Implementing a Server"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/socketserver/index.rst:56
msgid ""
"When creating a server, it is usually sufficient to reuse one of the "
"existing classes and provide a custom request handler class.  For other "
"cases, ``BaseServer`` includes several methods that can be overridden in "
"a subclass."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/socketserver/index.rst:61
msgid ""
"``verify_request(request, client_address)``: Return ``True`` to process "
"the request or ``False`` to ignore it. For example, a server could refuse"
" requests from an IP range or if it is overloaded."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/socketserver/index.rst:65
msgid ""
"``process_request(request, client_address)``: Calls ``finish_request()`` "
"to actually do the work of handling the request.  It can also create a "
"separate thread or process, as the mix-in classes do."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/socketserver/index.rst:70
msgid ""
"``finish_request(request, client_address)``: Creates a request handler "
"instance using the class given to the server's constructor. Calls "
"``handle()`` on the request handler to process the request."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/socketserver/index.rst:78
msgid ""
"Request handlers do most of the work of receiving incoming requests and "
"deciding what action to take. The handler is responsible for implementing"
" the protocol on top of the socket layer (i.e., HTTP, XML-RPC, or AMQP). "
"The request handler reads the request from the incoming data channel, "
"processes it, and writes a response back out. There are three methods "
"available to be over-ridden."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/socketserver/index.rst:85

"``setup()``: Prepares the request handler for the request. In the "
"``StreamRequestHandler`` the ``setup()`` method creates file-like objects"

"``EchoRequestHandler.handle()``, but versions of all of the methods "
"described earlier are included to illustrate the sequence of calls made."
"  The ``EchoServer`` class does nothing different from ``TCPServer``, "
"except log when each method is called."
