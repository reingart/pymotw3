"The ``textwrap`` module can be used to format text for output in "
"situations where pretty-printing is desired. It offers programmatic "
"functionality similar to the paragraph wrapping or filling features found"
" in many text editors and word processors."

"The results are something less than desirable.  The text is now left "

msgid ""
"The previous example has embedded tabs and extra spaces mixed into the "
"middle of the output, so it is not formatted very cleanly. Removing the "
"common whitespace prefix from all of the lines in the sample text with "
"``dedent()`` produces better results and allows the use of docstrings or "
"embedded multiline strings straight from Python code while removing the "
"formatting of the code itself. The sample string has an artificial indent"
" level introduced for illustrating this feature."

"Since \"dedent\" is the opposite of \"indent,\" the result is a block of "
