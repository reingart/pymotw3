"``zlib`` supports several different compression levels, allowing a "
"balance between computational cost and the amount of space reduction. The"
" default compression level, ``zlib.Z_DEFAULT_COMPRESSION`` is ``-1`` and "
"corresponds to a hard-coded value that compromises between performance "
"and compression outcome. This currently corresponds to level ``6``."

"A level of 0 means no compression at all. A level of 9 requires the most "

"The in-memory approach has drawbacks that make it impractical for real-"
"world use cases, primarily that the system needs enough memory to hold "
"both the uncompressed and compressed versions resident in memory at the "
"same time.  The alternative is to use ``Compress`` and ``Decompress`` "
"objects to manipulate data incrementally, so that the entire data set "
"does not have to fit into memory."

"This example reads small blocks of data from a plain text file and passes"
" it to ``compress()``.  The compressor maintains an internal buffer of "
"compressed data.  Since the compression algorithm depends on checksums "
"and minimum block sizes, the compressor may not be ready to return data "
"each time it receives more input.  If it does not have an entire "
"compressed block ready, it returns an empty byte string.  When all of the"
" data is fed in, the ``flush()`` method forces the compressor to close "
"the final block and return the rest of the compressed data."
