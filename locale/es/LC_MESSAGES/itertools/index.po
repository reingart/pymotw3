"The itertools module includes a set of functions for working with "
"sequence data sets."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/itertools/index.rst:12
msgid ""
"The functions provided by ``itertools`` are inspired by similar features "
"of functional programming languages such as Clojure, Haskell, APL, and "
"SML. They are intended to be fast and use memory efficiently, and also to"
" be hooked together to express more complicated iteration-based "
"algorithms."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/itertools/index.rst:18
msgid ""
"Iterator-based code offers better memory consumption characteristics than"
" code that uses lists.  Since data is not produced from the iterator "
"until it is needed, all of the data does not need to be stored in memory "
"at the same time.  This \"lazy\" processing model can reduce swapping and"
" other side-effects of large data sets, improving performance."
