"Although the Python standard library is extensive, there is also a robust"
" ecosystem of modules provided by third-party developers and available "
"from the `Python Package Index`_. This appendix describes some of these "
"modules, and the situations when you might want to use them to supplement"
" or even replace the standard library."

msgid "Text"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/third_party.rst:14
msgid ""
"The :mod:`string` module includes a very basic template tool. Many web "
"frameworks include more powerful template tools, but Jinja2_ and Mako_ "
"are popular standalone alternatives. Both support looping and conditional"
" control structures as well as other features for combining data with a "
"template to produce text output."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/third_party.rst:23
msgid ""
"The :mod:`re` module includes functions for searching and parsing text "
"using formally described patterns called regular expressions. It is not "
"the only way to parse text, though."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/third_party.rst:27
msgid ""
"The PLY_ package supports building parsers in the style of the GNU tools "
"lexx and yacc, commonly used for building language compilers. By "
"providing inputs describing the valid tokens, a grammar, and actions to "
"take when each are encountered, it is possible to build fully functional "
"compilers and interpreters, as well as more straightforward data parsers."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/third_party.rst:34
msgid ""
"PyParsing_ is a another tool for building parsers. The inputs are "
"instances of classes that can be chained together using operators and "
"method calls to build up a grammar."

#: ../../source/third_party.rst:38
msgid ""
"Finally, NLTK_ is a package for processing natural language text -- human"
" languages instead of computer languages. It supports parsing sentences "
"into parts of speech, finding the root form of words, and basic semantic "
"processing."

"The :mod:`functools` module includes some tools for creating decorators, "
"functions that wrap other functions to change how they behave. The wrapt_"
" package goes further than ``functools.wrap()`` to ensure that a "
"decorator is constructed properly and works for all edge-cases."
msgstr ""

msgid "Dates and Times"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/third_party.rst:61
msgid ""
"The :mod:`time` and :mod:`datetime` modules provide functions and classes"
" for manipulating time and date values. Both include functions for "
"parsing strings to turn them into internal representations. The dateutil_"
" package includes a more flexible parser that makes it easier to build "
"robust applications that are more forgiving of different input formats."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/third_party.rst:68
msgid ""
"The :mod:`datetime` module includes a timezone-aware class for "
"representing a specific time on a specific day. It does not, however, "
"include a full timezone database. The pytz_ package does provide such a "
"database. It is distributed separately from the standard library because "
"it is maintained by other authors and it is updated frequently when "
"timezone and daylight savings time values are changed by the political "
"institutions that control them."

"The :mod:`math` module contains fast implementations of advanced "
"mathematical functions. NumPy_ expands the set of functions supported to "
"include linear algebra and Fourier transform functions. It also includes "
"a fast multi-dimensional array implementation, improving on the version "
"in :mod:`array`."

"The examples in the :mod:`sqlite3` section run SQL statements directly "
"and work with low-level data structures. For large applications, it is "
"often desirable to map classes to tables in the database using an *object"
" relational mapper* or ORM. The sqlalchemy_ ORM library provides APIs for"
" associating classes with tables, building queries, and connecting to "
"different types of production-grade relational databases."
msgstr ""

"The lxml_ package wraps the libxml2 and libxslt libraries to create an "
"alternative to the XML parser in :mod:`xml.etree.ElementTree`. Developers"
" familiar with using those libraries from other languages may find lxml "
"easier to adopt in Python."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/third_party.rst:107
msgid ""
"The defusedxml_ package contains fixes for \"`Billion Laughs`_\" and "
"other entity expansion denial of service vulnerabilities in Python's XML "
"libraries and makes working with untrusted XML safer than using the "
"standard library alone."

"The team building the cryptography_ package says \"Our goal is for it to "
"be your 'cryptographic standard library'.\" The cryptography package "
"exposes high-level APIs to make it easy to add cryptographic features to "
"applications and the package is actively maintained with frequent "
"releases to address vulnerabilities in the underlying libraries such as "
"OpenSSL."

"The event loop built into :mod:`asyncio` is a reference implementation "
"based on the abstract API defined by the module. It is possible to "
"replace the event loop with a library such as uvloop_, which gives better"
" performance in exchange for adding extra application dependencies."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/third_party.rst:138

"The curio_ package is another concurrency package similar to asyncio but "
"with a smaller API that treats everything as a coroutine and does not "

"The requests_ package is a very popular replacement for "
":mod:`urllib.request`. It provides a consistent API for working with "
"remote resources addressable via HTTP, includes robust SSL support, and "
"can use connection pooling for better performance in multi-threaded "
"applications. It also provides features that make it well suited for "
"accessing REST APIs, such as built-in JSON parsing."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Python's :mod:`html` module includes a basic parser for well-formed HTML "
"data. However, real world data is rarely well structured, making parsing "
"it problematic. The BeautifulSoup_ and PyQuery_ libraries are "
"alternatives to :mod:`html` that are more robust in the face of messy "
"data. Both define APIs for parsing, modifying, and constructing HTML."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/third_party.rst:170
msgid ""
"The built-in :mod:`http.server` package includes base classes for "
"creating simple HTTP servers from scratch. It does not offer much support"
" beyond that for building web-based applications, though. The Django_ and"
" Pyramid_ packages are two popular web application frameworks that "
"provide more support for advanced features like request parsing, URL "
"routing, and cookie handling."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/third_party.rst:180
msgid ""
"Many existing libraries do not work with :mod:`asyncio` because they do "
"not integrate with the event loop. A new set of libraries such as "
"aiohttp_ is being created to fill this gap as part of the `aio-libs`_ "
"project."

"The API for :mod:`imaplib` is relatively low-level, requiring the caller "
"to understand the IMAP protocol to build queries and parse results. The "
"imapclient_ package provides a higher-level API that is easier to work "
"with for building applications that need to manipulate IMAP mailboxes."

"The two standard library modules for building command line interfaces, "
":mod:`argparse` and :mod:`getopt`, both separate the definition of "
"command line arguments from their parsing and value processing. "
"Alternatively, click_ (the \"Command Line Interface Construction Kit\"), "
"works by defining command processing functions and then associating "
"option and prompt definitions with those commands using decorators."
msgstr ""

"cliff_ (\"Command Line Interface Formulation Framework\") provides a set "
"of base classes for defining commands and a plugin system for extending "
"applications with multiple sub-commands that can be distributed in "
"separate packages. It uses :mod:`argparse` to build the help text and "
"argument parser, so the command line processing is familiar."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/third_party.rst:217

"The docopt_ package reverses the typical flow by asking the developer to "
"write the help text for a program, which it then parses to understand the"
" sub-commands, valid combinations of options, and sub-commands."

"For interactive terminal-based programs, `prompt_toolkit`_ includes "
"advanced features like color support, syntax highlighting, input editing,"
" mouse support, and searchable history. It can be used to build command-"
"oriented programs with a prompt loop like the :mod:`cmd` module, or full-"
"screen applications like text editors."

"While INI files such as used by :mod:`configparser` continue to be "
"popular for application configuration, the YAML_ file format is also very"
" popular. YAML provides many of the data structure features of JSON in a "
"format that is easier for people to read. The PyYAML_ library provides "
"access to a YAML parser and serializer."

"The fixtures_ package provides several test resource management classes "
"tailor made to work with the ``addCleanup()`` method of test cases from "
"the :mod:`unittest` module. The provided fixture classes can manage "
"loggers, environment variables, temporary files, and more in a consistent"
" and safe way that ensures each test case is completely isolated from "
"others in the suite."

"The :mod:`distutils` module in the standard library for packaging Python "
"modules for distribution and reuse is deprecated. The replacement, "
"setuptools_, is packaged separately from the standard library to make it "
"easier to deliver new versions frequently. The API for setuptools "
"includes tools for building the list of files to include in a package. "
"There are extensions to automatically build the list from the set of "
"files managed by a version control system. For example, using "
"`setuptools-git`_ with source in a git_ repository causes all of the "
"tracked files to be included in the package by default. After a package "
"is built, the twine_ application will upload it to the package index to "
"be shared with other developers."
