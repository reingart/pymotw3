"There are two ways to inject code to watch a program run: *tracing* and "
"*profiling*.  They are similar, but intended for different purposes and "
"so have different constraints.  The easiest, but least efficient, way to "
"monitor a program is through a *trace hook*, which can be used to write a"
" debugger, monitor code coverage, or achieve many other purposes."

"The trace hook is modified by passing a callback function to "
"``sys.settrace()``.  The callback will receive three arguments: the stack"
" frame from the code being run, a string naming the type of notification,"
" and an event-specific argument value.  :table:`Event Hooks for "
"settrace()` lists the seven event types for different levels of "
"information that occur as a program is being executed."
