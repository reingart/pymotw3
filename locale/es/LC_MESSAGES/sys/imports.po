"Most Python programs end up as a combination of several modules with a "
"main application importing them. Whether using the features of the "
"standard library or organizing custom code in separate files to make it "
"easier to maintain, understanding and managing the dependencies for a "
"program is an important aspect of development. ``sys`` includes "
"information about the modules available to an application, either as "
"built-ins or after being imported.  It also defines hooks for overriding "
"the standard import behavior for special cases."
