"The in-memory approach has obvious drawbacks that make it impractical for"

"This example reads small blocks of data from a plain-text file and passes"
" it to ``compress()``.  The compressor maintains an internal buffer of "
"compressed data.  Since the compression algorithm depends on checksums "
"and minimum block sizes, the compressor may not be ready to return data "
"each time it receives more input.  If it does not have an entire "
"compressed block ready, it returns an empty string.  When all of the data"
" is fed in, the ``flush()`` method forces the compressor to close the "
"final block and return the rest of the compressed data."
