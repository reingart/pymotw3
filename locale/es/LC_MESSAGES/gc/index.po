msgid ""
"``gc`` exposes the underlying memory management mechanism of Python, the "
"automatic garbage collector.  The module includes functions for "
"controlling how the collector operates and to examine the objects known "
"to the system, either pending collection or stuck in reference cycles and"
" unable to be freed."

msgid "Tracing References"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/gc/index.rst:19
msgid ""
"With ``gc`` the incoming and outgoing references between objects can be "
"used to find cycles in complex data structures.  If a data structure is "
"known to have a cycle, custom code can be used to examine its properties."
"  If the cycle is in unknown code, the ``get_referents()`` and "
"``get_referrers()`` functions can be used to build generic debugging "
"tools."

"For example, ``get_referents()`` shows the objects *referred to* by the "
"input arguments."

"In this case, the ``Graph`` instance ``three`` holds references to its "
"instance dictionary (in the ``__dict__`` attribute) and its class."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/gc/index.rst:55
msgid ""
"The next example uses a :mod:`Queue` to perform a breadth-first traversal"
" of all of the object references looking for cycles.  The items inserted "
"into the queue are tuples containing the reference chain so far and the "
"next object to examine.  It starts with ``three``, and looks at "
"everything it refers to.  Skipping classes avoids looking at methods, "
"modules, etc."

msgid ""
"The cycle in the nodes is easily found by watching for objects that have "
"already been processed.  To avoid holding references to those objects, "
"their ``id()`` values are cached in a set.  The dictionary objects found "
"in the cycle are the ``__dict__`` values for the ``Graph`` instances, and"
" hold their instance attributes."

msgid ""
"Although the garbage collector runs automatically as the interpreter "
"executes a program, it can be triggered to run at a specific time when "
"there are a lot of objects to free or there is not much work happening "
"and the collector will not hurt application performance.  Trigger "
"collection using ``collect()``."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/gc/index.rst:114
msgid ""
"In this example, the cycle is cleared as soon as collection runs the "
"first time, since nothing refers to the ``Graph`` nodes except "
"themselves.  ``collect()`` returns the number of \"unreachable\" objects "
"it found.  In this case, the value is ``6`` because there are three "
"objects with their instance attribute dictionaries."

#: ../../source/gc/index.rst:145
msgid ""
"Looking for the object holding a reference to another object is a little "
"trickier than seeing what an object references.  Because the code asking "
"about the reference needs to hold a reference itself, some of the "
"referrers need to be ignored.  This example creates a graph cycle, then "
"works through the ``Graph`` instances and removes the reference in the "
"\"parent\" node."

"This sort of logic is overkill if the cycles are understood, but for an "
"unexplained cycle in data using ``get_referrers()`` can expose the "
"unexpected relationship."

msgid ""
"The garbage collector maintains three lists of objects it sees as it "
"runs, one for each \"generation\" tracked by the collector.  As objects "
"are examined in each generation, they are either collected or they age "
"into subsequent generations until they finally reach the stage where they"
" are kept permanently."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/gc/index.rst:210
msgid ""
"The collector routines can be tuned to occur at different frequencies "
"based on the difference between the number of object allocations and "
"deallocations between runs.  When the number of allocations minus the "
"number of deallocations is greater than the threshold for the generation,"
" the garbage collector is run.  The current thresholds can be examined "
"with ``get_threshold()``."

"The thresholds can be changed with ``set_threshold()``.  This example "

"Debugging memory leaks can be challenging.  ``gc`` includes several "
"options to expose the inner workings to make the job easier.  The options"

"information is printed to ``sys.stderr``."

"The ``DEBUG_STATS`` flag turns on statistics reporting, causing the "

"Enabling ``DEBUG_COLLECTABLE`` and ``DEBUG_UNCOLLECTABLE`` causes the "
