"The base64 module contains functions for translating binary data into a "
"subset of ASCII suitable for transmission using plaintext protocols."

msgid ""
"The base64, base32, base16, and base85 encodings convert 8 bit bytes to "
"values that fit inside the ASCII range of printable characters, trading "
"more bits to represent the data for compatibility with systems that only "
"support ASCII data, such as SMTP.  The *base* values correspond to the "
"length of the alphabet used in each encoding.  There are also URL-safe "
"variations of the original encodings that use slightly different "
"alphabets."

"The input must be a byte string, so the unicode string is first encoded "
"to UTF-8. The output shows the 185 bytes of the UTF-8 source expand to "
"248 bytes after being encoded."

"``b64decode()`` converts an encoded string back to the original form by "

"The encoding process looks at each sequence of 24 bits in the input "
"(three bytes) and encodes those same 24 bits spread over four bytes in "
"the output.  The equal signs at the end of the output are padding "
"inserted because the number of bits in the original string was not evenly"
" divisible by 24, in this example."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The value returned from ``b64decode()`` is a byte string. If the contents"
" are known to be text, the byte string can be converted to a unicode "
"object. However, the point of using base 64 encoding is to be able to "
"transmit binary data, and so it is not always safe to assume that the "
"decoded value is text."
