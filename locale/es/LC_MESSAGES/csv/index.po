"The ``csv`` module can be used to work with data exported from "
"spreadsheets and databases into text files formatted with fields and "
"records, commonly referred to as *comma-separated value* (CSV) format "

"The first argument to ``reader()`` is the source of text lines. In this "

"control how the input data is parsed."
