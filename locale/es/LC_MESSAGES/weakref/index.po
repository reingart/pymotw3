msgid "weakref --- Impermanent References to Objects"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/weakref/index.rst:8
msgid ""
"Refer to an \"expensive\" object, but allow its memory to be reclaimed by"
" the garbage collector if there are no other non-weak references."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/weakref/index.rst:12
msgid ""
"The ``weakref`` module supports weak references to objects. A normal "
"reference increments the reference count on the object and prevents it "
"from being garbage collected. This outcome is not always desirable, "
"especially when a circular reference might be present or when a cache of "
"objects should be deleted when memory is needed.  A weak reference is a "
"handle to an object that does not keep it from being cleaned up "
"automatically."

"In this case, since ``obj`` is deleted before the second call to the "

#: ../../source/weakref/index.rst:61

"The callback receives the reference object as an argument after the "

msgid "Finalizing Objects"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/weakref/index.rst:88
msgid ""
"For more robust management of resources when weak references are cleaned "
"up, use ``finalize`` to associate callbacks with objects. A ``finalize`` "
"instance is retained until the attached object is deleted, even if the "
"application does not retain a reference to the finalizer."

"The arguments to ``finalize`` are the object to track, a callable to "

"The ``finalize`` instance has a writable propertly ``atexit`` to control "

"Giving the ``finalize`` instance a reference to the object it tracks "

"As this example shows, even though the explicit reference to ``obj`` is "

msgid "Proxies"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/weakref/index.rst:193
msgid ""
"It is sometimes more convenient to use a proxy, rather than a weak "
"reference.  Proxies can be used as though they were the original object, "
"and do not need to be called before the object is accessible. As a "
"consequence, they can be passed to a library that does not know it is "
"receiving a reference instead of the real object."

msgid ""
"The ``ref`` and ``proxy`` classes are considered \"low level.\" While "
"they are useful for maintaining weak references to individual objects and"
" allowing cycles to be garbage collected, the ``WeakKeyDictionary`` and "
"``WeakValueDictionary`` classes provide a more appropriate API for "
"creating a cache of several objects."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/weakref/index.rst:234
msgid ""
"The ``WeakValueDictionary`` class uses weak references to the values it "
"holds, allowing them to be garbage collected when other code is not "
"actually using them.  Using explicit calls to the garbage collector "
"illustrates the difference between memory handling with a regular "
"dictionary and ``WeakValueDictionary``:"

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/weakref/index.rst:244
msgid ""
"Any loop variables that refer to the values being cached must be cleared "
"explicitly so the reference count of the object is decremented. "
"Otherwise, the garbage collector will not remove the objects and they "
"will remain in the cache. Similarly, the ``all_refs`` variable is used to"
" hold references to prevent them from being garbage collected "
"prematurely."

"The ``WeakKeyDictionary`` works similarly but uses weak references for "

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/weakref/index.rst:308
msgid ""
"Caution: Because a ``WeakValueDictionary`` is built on top of a Python "
"dictionary, it must not change size when iterating over it. This can be "
"difficult to ensure for a ``WeakValueDictionary`` because actions "
"performed by the program during iteration may cause items in the "
"dictionary to vanish \"by magic\" (as a side effect of garbage "
"collection)."
