"Although SQLite does not have user access controls found in other, "
"larger, relational databases, it does have a mechanism for limiting "
"access to columns.  Each connection can install an *authorizer function* "
"to grant or deny access to columns at runtime based on any desired "
"criteria.  The authorizer function is invoked during the parsing of SQL "
"statements, and is passed five arguments.  The first is an action code "
"indicating the type of operation being performed (reading, writing, "
"deleting, etc.).  The rest of the arguments depend on the action code.  "
"For ``SQLITE_READ`` operations, the arguments are the name of the table, "
"the name of the column, the location in the SQL where the access is "
"occurring (main query, trigger, etc.), and ``None``."
