msgid ""
"In addition to managing coroutines and I/O callbacks, the ``asyncio`` "
"event loop can schedule calls to regular functions based on the timer "
"value kept in the loop."

msgid "Scheduling a Callback \"Soon\""
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/scheduling.rst:12
msgid ""
"If the timing of the callback does not matter, ``call_soon()`` can be "
"used to schedule the call for the next iteration of the loop. Any extra "
"positional arguments after the function are passed to the callback when "
"it is invoked. To pass keyword arguments to the callback, use "
"``partial()`` from the :mod:`functools` module."

msgid "Scheduling a Callback with a Delay"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/scheduling.rst:43
msgid ""
"To postpone a callback until some time in the future, use "
"``call_later()``. The first argument is the delay in seconds and the "
"second argument is the callback."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/scheduling.rst:51
msgid ""
"In this example, the same callback function is scheduled for several "
"different times with different arguments. The final instance, using "
"``call_soon()``, results in the callback being invoked with the argument "
"``3`` before any of the time-scheduled instances, showing that \"soon\" "
"usually implies a minimal delay."

msgid "Scheduling a Callback for a Specific Time"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/scheduling.rst:77
msgid ""
"It is also possible to schedule a call to occur at a specific time. The "
"loop uses a monotonic clock, rather than a wall-clock time, to ensure "
"that the value of \"now\" never regresses. To choose a time for a "
"scheduled callback it is necessary to start from the internal state of "
"that clock using the loop's ``time()`` method."
