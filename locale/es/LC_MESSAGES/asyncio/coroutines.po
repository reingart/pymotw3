msgid ""
"Coroutines are a language construct designed for concurrent operation. A "
"coroutine function creates a coroutine object when called, and the caller"
" can then run the code of the function using the coroutine's ``send()`` "
"method. A coroutine can pause execution using the ``await`` keyword with "
"another coroutine. While it is paused, the coroutine's state is "
"maintained, allowing it to resume where it left off the next time it is "
"awakened."

"There are a few different ways to have the ``asyncio`` event loop start a"
" coroutine. The simplest is to use ``run_until_complete()``, passing the "
"coroutine to it directly."

"The first step is to obtain a reference to the event loop. The default "
"loop type can be used, or a specific loop class can be instantiated. In "
"this example, the default loop is used. The ``run_until_complete()`` "
"method starts the loop with the coroutine object and stops the loop when "
"the coroutine exits by returning."

"In this case, ``run_until_complete()`` also returns the result of the "

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/coroutines.rst:75
msgid ""
"One coroutine can start another coroutine and wait for the results. This "
"makes it easier to decompose a task into reusable parts. The following "
"example has two phases that must be executed in order, but that can run "
"concurrently with other operations."

msgid "asyncio_coroutine_chain.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/coroutines.rst:84
msgid ""
"The ``await`` keyword is used instead of adding the new coroutines to the"
" loop, because control flow is already inside of a coroutine being "
"managed by the loop so it isn't necessary to tell the loop to manage the "
"new coroutines."

msgid "Generators Instead of Coroutines"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/coroutines.rst:109
msgid ""
"Coroutine functions are a key component of the design of ``asyncio``. "
"They provide a language construct for stopping the execution of part of a"
" program, preserving the state of that call, and re-entering the state at"
" a later time, which are all important capabilities for a concurrency "
"framework."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/coroutines.rst:115
msgid ""
"Python 3.5 introduced new language features to define such coroutines "
"natively using ``async def`` and to yield control using ``await``, and "
"the examples for ``asyncio`` take advantage of the new feature. Earlier "
"versions of Python 3 can use generator functions wrapped with the "
"``asyncio.coroutine()`` decorator and ``yield from`` to achieve the same "
"effect."
