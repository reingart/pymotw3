"Although ``asyncio`` applications usually run as a single-threaded "
"process, they are still built as concurrent applications. Each coroutine "
"or task may execute in an unpredictable order, based on delays and "
"interrupts from I/O and other external events. To support safe "
"concurrency, ``asyncio`` includes implementations of some of the same "
"low-level primitives found in the :mod:`threading` and "
":mod:`multiprocessing` modules."

msgid "Locks"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/synchronization.rst:16
msgid ""
"A ``Lock`` can be used to guard access to a shared resource. Only the "
"holder of the lock can use the resource. Multiple attempts to acquire the"
" lock will block so that there is only one holder at a time."
msgstr ""

msgid "asyncio_lock.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/synchronization.rst:25
msgid ""
"A lock can be invoked directly, using ``await`` to acquire it and calling"
" the ``release()`` method when done as in ``coro2()`` in this example. "
"They also can be used as asynchronous context managers with the ``with "
"await`` keywords, as in ``coro1()``."

msgid "Events"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/synchronization.rst:54
msgid ""
"An ``asyncio.Event`` is based on ``threading.Event``, and is used to "
"allow multiple consumers to wait for something to happen without looking "
"for a specific value to be associated with the notification."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/synchronization.rst
msgid "asyncio_event.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/synchronization.rst:63
msgid ""
"As with the ``Lock``, both ``coro1()`` and ``coro2()`` wait for the event"
" to be set. The difference is that both can start as soon as the event "
"state changes, and they do not need to acquire a unique hold on the event"
" object."
msgstr ""

msgid "Conditions"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/synchronization.rst:89
msgid ""
"A ``Condition`` works similarly to an ``Event`` except that rather than "
"notifying all waiting coroutines the number of waiters awakened is "
"controlled with an argument to ``notify()``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/synchronization.rst
msgid "asyncio_condition.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/synchronization.rst:97
msgid ""
"This example starts five consumers of the ``Condition``. Each uses the "
"``wait()`` method to wait for a notification that they can proceed. "
"``manipulate_condition()`` notifies one consumer, then two consumers, "
"then all of the remaining consumers."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/synchronization.rst:134
msgid "Queues"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/synchronization.rst:136
msgid ""
"An ``asyncio.Queue`` provides a first-in, first-out data structure for "
"coroutines like a ``queue.Queue`` does for threads or a "
"``multiprocessing.Queue`` does for processes."
msgstr ""

msgid "asyncio_queue.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/synchronization.rst:144
msgid ""
"Adding items with ``put()`` or removing items with ``get()`` are both "
"asynchronous operations, since the queue size might be fixed (blocking an"
" addition) or the queue might be empty (blocking a call to fetch an "
"item)."
