msgid ""
"Linear control flow between a series of coroutines is easy to manage with"
" the built-in language keyword ``await``. More complicated structures "
"allowing one coroutine to wait for several others to complete in parallel"
" are also possible using tools in ``asyncio``."

"It is often useful to divide one operation into many parts and execute "
"them separately. For example, downloading several remote resources or "
"querying remote APIs. In situations where the order of execution doesn't "
"matter, and where there may be an arbitrary number of operations, "
"``wait()`` can be used to pause one coroutine until the other background "
"operations complete."

msgid "asyncio_wait.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/control.rst:24
msgid ""
"Internally, ``wait()`` uses a ``set`` to hold the ``Task`` instances it "
"creates. This results in them starting, and finishing, in an "
"unpredictable order.  The return value from ``wait()`` is a tuple "
"containing two sets holding the finished and pending tasks."

#: ../../source/asyncio/control.rst:49

"There will only be pending operations left if ``wait()`` is used with a "
"timeout value."

msgid ""
"Those remaining background operations should either be cancelled or "
"finished by waiting for them. Leaving them pending while the event loop "
"continues will let them execute further, which may not be desirable if "
"the overall operation is considered aborted. Leaving them pending at the "
"end of the process will result in warnings being reported."

msgid "Gathering Results from Coroutines"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/control.rst:88
msgid ""
"If the background phases are well-defined, and only the results of those "
"phases matter, then ``gather()`` may be more useful for waiting for "
"multiple operations."

msgid "asyncio_gather.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/control.rst:96
msgid ""
"The tasks created by gather are not exposed, so they cannot be cancelled."
" The return value is a list of results in the same order as the arguments"
" passed to ``gather()``, regardless of the order the background "
"operations actually completed."

#: ../../source/asyncio/control.rst:122
msgid ""
"``as_completed()`` is a generator that manages the execution of a list of"
" coroutines given to it and produces their results one at a time as they "
"finish running. As with ``wait()``, order is not guaranteed by "
"``as_completed()``, but it is not necessary to wait for all of the "
"background operations to complete before taking other action."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/control.rst:133
msgid ""
"This example starts several background phases that finish in the reverse "
"order from which they start. As the generator is consumed, the loop waits"
" for the result of the coroutine using ``await``."
