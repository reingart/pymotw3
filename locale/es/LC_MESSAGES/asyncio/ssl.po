msgid ""
"``asyncio`` has built-in support for enabling SSL communication on "
"sockets. Passing an ``SSLContext`` instance to the coroutines that create"
" server or client connections enables the support and ensures that the "
"SSL protocol setup is taken care of before the socket is presented as "
"ready for the application to use."

#: ../../source/asyncio/ssl.rst:11
msgid ""
"The coroutine-based echo server and client from the previous section can "
"be updated with a few small changes. The first step is to create the "
"certificate and key files. A self-signed certificate can be created with "
"a command like:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/ssl.rst:21
msgid ""
"The ``openssl`` command will prompt for several values that are used to "
"generate the certificate, and then produce the output files requested."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/ssl.rst:25
msgid ""
"The insecure socket setup in the previous server example uses "
"``start_server()`` to create the listening socket."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/ssl.rst:31
msgid ""
"To add encryption, create an ``SSLContext`` with the certificate and key "
"just generated and then pass the context to ``start_server()``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/ssl.rst:38
msgid ""
"Similar changes are needed in the client. The old version uses "
"``open_connection()`` to create the socket connected to the server."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/ssl.rst:44
msgid ""
"An ``SSLContext`` is needed again to secure the client-side of the "
"socket. Client identity is not being enforced, so only the certificate "
"needs to be loaded."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/ssl.rst:51
msgid ""
"One other small changes is needed in the client. Because the SSL "
"connection does not support sending an end-of-file (EOF), the client uses"
" a NULL byte as a message terminator instead."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/ssl.rst:55
msgid "The old version of the client send loop uses ``write_eof()``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/ssl.rst:60
msgid "The new version sends a zero byte (``b'\\x00'``)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/ssl.rst:65
msgid ""
"The ``echo()`` coroutine in the server must look for the NULL byte and "
"close the client connection when it is received."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/ssl.rst:71
msgid ""
"Running the server in one window, and the client in another, produces "
"this output."
