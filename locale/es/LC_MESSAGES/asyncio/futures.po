"A ``Future`` represents the result of work that has not been completed "
"yet. The event loop can watch for a ``Future`` object's state to indicate"
" that it is done, allowing one part of an application to wait for another"
" part to finish some work."

msgid "Waiting for a Future"

#: ../../source/asyncio/futures.rst:13
msgid ""
"A ``Future`` acts like a coroutine, so any techniques useful for waiting "
"for a coroutine can also be used to wait for the future to be marked "
"done. This example passes the future to the event loop's "
"``run_until_complete()`` method."

#: ../../source/asyncio/futures.rst:22
msgid ""
"The state of the ``Future`` changes to done when ``set_result()`` is "
"called, and the ``Future`` instance retains the result given to the "
"method for retrieval later."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/futures.rst:43
msgid ""
"A ``Future`` can also be used with the ``await`` keyword, as in this "
"example."

#: ../../source/asyncio/futures.rst:50
msgid ""
"The result of the ``Future`` is returned by ``await``, so it is "
"frequently possible to have the same code work with a regular coroutine "
"and a ``Future`` instance."

msgid "Future Callbacks"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/futures.rst:71
msgid ""
"In addition to working like a coroutine, a ``Future`` can invoke "
"callbacks when it is completed. Callbacks are invoked in the order they "
"are registered."

msgid "asyncio_future_callback.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/futures.rst:79
msgid ""
"The callback should expect one argument, the ``Future`` instance. To pass"
" additional arguments to the callbacks, use ``functools.partial()`` to "
"create a wrapper."
