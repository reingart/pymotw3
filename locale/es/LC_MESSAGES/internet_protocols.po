"The Internet is a pervasive aspect of modern computing.  Even small, "
"single-use scripts frequently interact with remote services to send or "
"receive data.  Python's rich set of tools for working with web protocols "
"makes it well suited for programming web-based applications, either as a "
"client or a server."

"The :mod:`urllib.parse` module manipulates URL strings, splitting and "
"combining their components, and is useful in clients and servers."

"The :mod:`urllib.request` module implements an API for retrieving content"
" remotely."

"HTTP POST requests are usually \"form encoded\" with :mod:`urllib`. "
"Binary data sent through a POST should be encoded with :mod:`base64` "
"first, to comply with the message format standard."

#: ../../source/internet_protocols.rst:21
msgid ""
"Well-behaved clients that access many sites as a spider or crawler should"
" use :mod:`urllib.robotparser` to ensure they have permission before "
"placing a heavy load on the remote server."

msgid ""
"To create a custom web server with Python, without requiring any external"
" frameworks, use :mod:`http.server` as a starting point.  It handles the "
"HTTP protocol, so the only customization needed is the application code "
"for responding to the incoming requests."

msgid ""
"Session state in the server can be managed through cookies created and "
"parsed by the :mod:`http.cookies` module.  Full support for expiration, "
"path, domain, and other cookie settings makes it easy to configure the "
"session."

msgid ""
"The :mod:`uuid` module is used for generating identifiers for resources "
"that need unique values.  UUIDs are good for automatically generating "
"Uniform Resource Name (URN) values, where the name of the resource needs "
"to be unique but does not need to convey any meaning."

msgid ""
"Python's standard library includes support for two web-based remote "
"procedure call mechanisms.  The JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) "
"encoding scheme used in AJAX communication and REST API is implemented in"
" :mod:`json`.  It works equally well in the client or the server. "
"Complete XML-RPC client and server libraries are also included in "
":mod:`xmlrpc.client` and :mod:`xmlrpc.server` respectively."
