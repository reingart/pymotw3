"In addition to its parsing capabilities, ``xml.etree.ElementTree`` also "
"supports creating well-formed XML documents from ``Element`` objects "
"constructed in an application.  The ``Element`` class used when a "
"document is parsed also knows how to generate a serialized form of its "
"contents, which can then be written to a file or other data stream."

"There are three helper functions useful for creating a hierarchy of "
"``Element`` nodes.  ``Element()`` creates a standard node, "
"``SubElement()`` attaches a new node to a parent, and ``Comment()`` "
"creates a node that serializes using XML's comment syntax."

"``ElementTree`` makes no effort to format the output of ``tostring()`` to"

"The previous example created nodes with tags and text content, but did "
"not set any attributes of the nodes.  Many of the examples from "
":ref:`xml.etree.ElementTree.parsing` worked with an OPML file listing "
"podcasts and their feeds.  The ``outline`` nodes in the tree used "
"attributes for the group names and podcast properties. ``ElementTree`` "
"can be used to construct a similar XML file from a CSV input file, "

"This example uses two techniques to set the attribute values of new "
