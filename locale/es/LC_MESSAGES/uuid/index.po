":rfc:`4122` defines a system for creating universally unique identifiers "
"for resources in a way that does not require a central registrar. UUID "
"values are 128 bits long and, as the reference guide says, \"can "
"guarantee uniqueness across space and time.\" They are useful for "
"generating identifiers for documents, hosts, application clients, and "
"other situations where a unique value is necessary. The RFC is "
"specifically focused on creating a Uniform Resource Name namespace and "
"covers three main algorithms:"
