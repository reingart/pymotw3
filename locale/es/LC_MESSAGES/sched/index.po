msgid ""
"The ``sched`` module implements a generic event scheduler for running "
"tasks at specific times. The scheduler class uses a ``time`` function to "
"learn the current time, and a ``delay`` function to wait for a specific "
"period of time. The actual units of time are not important, which makes "
"the interface flexible enough to be used for many purposes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/sched/index.rst:17
msgid ""
"The ``time`` function is called without any arguments, and should return "
"a number representing the current time. The ``delay`` function is called "
"with a single integer argument, using the same scale as the time "
"function, and should wait that many time units before returning. By "
"default ``monotonic()`` and ``sleep()`` from :mod:`time` are used, but "
"the examples in this section use ``time.time()``, which also meets the "
"requirements, because it makes the output easier to understand."

"To support multi-threaded applications, the delay function is called with"
" argument 0 after each event is generated, to ensure that other threads "

"Events can be scheduled to run after a delay, or at a specific time. To "
"schedule them with a delay, use the ``enter()`` method, which takes four "
"arguments."

"This example schedules two different events to run after two and three "

msgid "Overlapping Events"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The call to ``run()`` blocks until all of the events have been processed."
" Each event is run in the same thread, so if an event takes longer to run"
" than the delay between events, there will be overlap. The overlap is "
"resolved by postponing the later event. No events are lost, but some "
"events may be called later than they were scheduled. In the next example,"
" ``long_event()`` sleeps but it could just as easily delay by performing "
"a long calculation or by blocking on I/O."

"The result is the second event is run immediately after the first "

"This example needs to ensure that they are scheduled for the exact same "
"time, so the ``enterabs()`` method is used instead of ``enter()``. The "
"first argument to ``enterabs()`` is the time to run the event, instead of"
" the amount of time to delay."

"Both ``enter()`` and ``enterabs()`` return a reference to the event that "
