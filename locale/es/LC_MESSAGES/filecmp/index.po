"The ``shallow`` argument tells ``cmp()`` whether to look at the contents "
"of the file, in addition to its metadata. The default is to perform a "
"shallow comparison using the information available from ``os.stat()``. If"
" the stat results are the same, the files are considered the same so "
"files of the same size created at the same time are reported as the same,"
" even if their contents differ. When ``shallow`` is ``False``, the "
"contents of the file are always compared."

"To compare a set of files in two directories without recursing, use "
"``cmpfiles()``. The arguments are the names of the directories and a list"
" of files to be checked in the two locations. The list of common files "
"passed in should contain only filenames (directories always result in a "
"mismatch) and the files must be present in both locations. The next "
"example shows a simple way to build the common list. The comparison also "
"takes the ``shallow`` flag, just as with ``cmp()``."

"The functions described earlier are suitable for relatively simple "
