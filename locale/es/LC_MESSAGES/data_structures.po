"Python includes several standard programming data structures, such as "
"``list``, ``tuple``, ``dict``, and ``set``, as part of its built-in "
"types.  Many applications do not require other structures, but when they "
"do, the standard library provides powerful and well-tested versions that "
"are ready to be used."

"The :mod:`enum` module provides an implementation of an *enumeration* "
"type, with iteration and comparison capabilities. It can be used to "
"create well-defined symbols for values, instead of using literal strings "
"or integers."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/data_structures.rst:16
msgid ""
"The :mod:`collections` module includes implementations of several data "
"structures that extend those found in other modules.  For example, "
"``Deque`` is a double-ended queue, which allows the addition or removal "
"of items from either end.  The ``defaultdict`` is a dictionary that "
"responds with a default value if a key is missing, while ``OrderedDict`` "
"remembers the sequence in which items are added to it.  ``namedtuple`` "
"extends the normal ``tuple`` to give each member item an attribute name "
"in addition to a numeric index."

#: ../../source/data_structures.rst:26
msgid ""
"For large amounts of data, an :mod:`array` may make more efficient use of"
" memory than a ``list``.  Since the ``array`` is limited to a single data"
" type, it can use a more compact memory representation than a general-"
"purpose ``list``.  At the same time, ``array`` instances can be "
"manipulated using many of the same methods as a ``list``, so it may be "
"possible to replace a ``list`` with an ``array`` in an application "
"without a lot of other changes."

msgid ""
"Sorting items in a sequence is a fundamental aspect of data manipulation."
"  Python's ``list`` includes a ``sort()`` method, but sometimes it is "
"more efficient to maintain a list in sorted order without re-sorting it "
"each time its contents are changed.  The functions in :mod:`heapq` modify"
" the contents of a list while preserving the sort order of the list with "
"low overhead."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/data_structures.rst:42
msgid ""
"Another option for building sorted lists or arrays is :mod:`bisect`. It "
"uses a binary search to find the insertion point for new items, and is an"
" alternative to repeatedly sorting a list that changes frequently."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/data_structures.rst:47
msgid ""
"Although the built-in ``list`` can simulate a queue using the "
"``insert()`` and ``pop()`` methods, it is not thread-safe.  For true "
"ordered communication between threads use the :mod:`queue` module.  "
":mod:`multiprocessing` includes a version of a ``Queue`` that works "
"between processes, making it easier to convert a multithreaded program to"
" use processes instead."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/data_structures.rst:54
msgid ""
":mod:`struct` is useful for decoding data from another application, "
"perhaps coming from a binary file or stream of data, into Python's native"
" types for easier manipulation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/data_structures.rst:58
msgid ""
"This chapter covers two modules related to memory management.  For highly"
" interconnected data structures, such as graphs and trees, use "
":mod:`weakref` to maintain references while still allowing the garbage "
"collector to clean up objects after they are no longer needed.  Use the "
"functions in :mod:`copy` for duplicating data structures and their "
"contents, including making recursive copies with ``deepcopy()``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/data_structures.rst:65
msgid ""
"Debugging data structures can be time consuming, especially when wading "
"through printed output of large sequences or dictionaries.  Use "
":mod:`pprint` to create easy-to-read representations that can be printed "
"to the console or written to a log file for easier debugging."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/data_structures.rst:70
msgid ""
"Finally, if the available types do not meet the requirements, subclass "
"one of the native types and customize it, or build a new container type "
"using one of the abstract base classes defined in :mod:`collections` as a"
" starting point."
