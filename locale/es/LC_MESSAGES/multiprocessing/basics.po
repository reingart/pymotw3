"It usually more useful to be able to spawn a process with arguments to "
"tell it what work to do.  Unlike with ``threading``, in order to pass "
"arguments to a ``multiprocessing`` ``Process`` the arguments must be able"
" to be serialized using :mod:`pickle`.  This example passes each worker a"
" number to be printed."

"One difference between the ``threading`` and ``multiprocessing`` examples"
" is the extra protection for ``__main__`` used in the ``multiprocessing``"
" examples.  Due to the way the new processes are started, the child "
"process needs to be able to import the script containing the target "
"function.  Wrapping the main part of the application in a check for "
"``__main__`` ensures that it is not run recursively in each child as the "
"module is imported.  Another approach is to import the target function "
"from a separate script.  For example, ``multiprocessing_import_main.py`` "
"uses a worker function defined in a second module."
