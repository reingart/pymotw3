"As with threads, a common use pattern for multiple processes is to divide"
" a job up among several workers to run in parallel.  Effective use of "
"multiple processes usually requires some communication between them, so "
"that work can be divided and results can be aggregated.  A simple way to "
"communicate between processes with ``multiprocessing`` is to use a "
"``Queue`` to pass messages back and forth.  Any object that can be "
"serialized with :mod:`pickle` can pass through a ``Queue``."

"A more complex example shows how to manage several workers consuming data"
" from a ``JoinableQueue`` and passing results back to the parent process."
"  The *poison pill* technique is used to stop the workers.  After setting"
" up the real tasks, the main program adds one \"stop\" value per worker "
"to the job queue.  When a worker encounters the special value, it breaks "
"out of its processing loop.  The main process uses the task queue's "
"``join()`` method to wait for all of the tasks to finish before "
"processing the results."

"The ``Event`` class provides a simple way to communicate state "

"Sometimes it is useful to allow more than one worker access to a resource"

"In this example, the ``ActivePool`` class simply serves as a convenient "

"The result of the ``map()`` method is functionally equivalent to the "
