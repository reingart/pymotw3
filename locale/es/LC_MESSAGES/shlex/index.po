"The ``shlex`` module implements a class for parsing simple shell-like "
"syntaxes. It can be used for writing a domain-specific language, or for "
"parsing quoted strings (a task that is more complex than it seems on the "
"surface)."

msgid ""
"A common problem when working with input text is to identify a sequence "
"of quoted words as a single entity. Splitting the text on quotes does not"
" always work as expected, especially if there are nested levels of "
"quotes. Take the following text as an example."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/shlex/index.rst:26
msgid ""
"A naive approach would be to construct a regular expression to find the "
"parts of the text outside the quotes to separate them from the text "
"inside the quotes, or vice versa. That would be unnecessarily complex and"
" prone to errors resulting from edge cases like apostrophes or even "
"typos. A better solution is to use a true parser, such as the one "
"provided by the ``shlex`` module. Here is a simple example that prints "
"the tokens identified in the input file using the ``shlex`` class."

"It is still usually safer to use a list of arguments when using "

"``quote()`` provides some protection by ensuring that special characters "
"and white space are quoted properly."

msgid "Embedded Comments"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/shlex/index.rst:148
msgid ""
"Since the parser is intended to be used with command languages, it needs "
"to handle comments. By default, any text following a ``#`` is considered "
"part of a comment and ignored. Due to the nature of the parser, only "
"single-character comment prefixes are supported. The set of comment "
"characters used can be configured through the :attr:`commenters` "
"property."

msgid ""
"The ``shlex`` class includes several configuration properties that "
"control its behavior. The :attr:`source` property enables a feature for "
"code (or configuration) re-use by allowing one token stream to include "
"another. This is similar to the Bourne shell ``source`` operator, hence "
"the name."

msgid "shlex_source.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/shlex/index.rst:222
msgid ""
"The string \"``source quotes.txt``\" in the original text receives "
"special handling. Since the :attr:`source` property of the lexer is set "
"to ``\"source\"``, when the keyword is encountered, the filename "
"appearing on the next line is automatically included. In order to cause "
"the filename to appear as a single token, the ``.`` character needs to be"
" added to the list of characters that are included in words (otherwise "
"\"``quotes.txt``\" becomes three tokens, \"``quotes``\", \"``.``\", "
"\"``txt``\"). This what the output looks like."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/shlex/index.rst:266
msgid ""
"The source feature uses a method called ``sourcehook()`` to load the "
"additional input source, so a subclass of ``shlex`` can provide an "
"alternate implementation that loads data from locations other than files."

msgid ""
"An earlier example demonstrated changing the :attr:`wordchars` value to "
"control which characters are included in words. It is also possible to "
"set the :attr:`quotes` character to use additional or alternative quotes."
" Each quote must be a single character, so it is not possible to have "
"different open and close quotes (no parsing on parentheses, for example)."

msgid "Error Handling"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/shlex/index.rst:345
msgid ""
"When the parser encounters the end of its input before all quoted strings"
" are closed, it raises ``ValueError``. When that happens, it is useful to"
" examine some of the properties maintained by the parser as it processes "
"the input. For example, :attr:`infile` refers to the name of the file "
"being processed (which might be different from the original file, if one "
"file sources another). The :attr:`lineno` reports the line when the error"
" is discovered. The :attr:`lineno` is typically the end of the file, "
"which may be far away from the first quote. The :attr:`token` attribute "
"contains the buffer of text not already included in a valid token. The "
"``error_leader()`` method produces a message prefix in a style similar to"
" Unix compilers, which enables editors such as ``emacs`` to parse the "
"error and take the user directly to the invalid line."
