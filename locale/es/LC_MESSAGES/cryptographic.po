"Encryption secures messages so that they can be verified as accurate and "
"protected from interception.  Python's cryptography support includes "
":mod:`hashlib` for generating signatures of message content using "
"standard algorithms such as MD5 and SHA, and :mod:`hmac` for verifying "
"that a message has not been altered in transmission."
