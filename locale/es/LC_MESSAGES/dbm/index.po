"``dbm`` is a front-end for DBM-style databases that use simple string "
"values as keys to access records containing strings.  It uses "
"``whichdb()`` to identify databases, then opens them with the appropriate"
" module.  It is used as a back-end for :mod:`shelve`, which stores "
"objects in a DBM database using :mod:`pickle`."

"Python comes with several modules for accessing DBM-style databases. The "
"default implementation selected depends on the libraries available on the"
" current system and the options used when Python was compiled. Separate "
"interfaces to the specific implementations allow Python programs to "
"exchange data with programs in other languages that do not automatically "
"switch between available formats, or to write portable data files that "
"will work on multiple platforms."
