"The ``select`` module provides access to platform-specific I/O monitoring"
" functions.  The most portable interface is the POSIX function "
"``select()``, which is available on Unix and Windows.  The module also "
"includes ``poll()``, a Unix-only API, and several options that only work "
"with specific variants of Unix."

"The new :mod:`selectors` module provides a higher-level interface built "
"on top of the APIs in ``select``. It is easier to build portable code "
"using ``selectors``, so use that module unless the low-level APIs "
"provided by ``select`` are somehow required."

msgid ""
"Python's ``select()`` function is a direct interface to the underlying "
"operating system implementation.  It monitors sockets, open files, and "
"pipes (anything with a ``fileno()`` method that returns a valid file "
"descriptor) until they become readable or writable or a communication "
"error occurs.  ``select()`` makes it easier to monitor multiple "
"connections at the same time, and is more efficient than writing a "
"polling loop in Python using socket timeouts, because the monitoring "
"happens in the operating system network layer, instead of the "
"interpreter."

"The echo server example from the :mod:`socket` section can be extended to"
" watch for more than one connection at a time by using ``select()``.  The"

"The arguments to ``select()`` are three lists containing communication "
"channels to monitor.  The first is a list of the objects to be checked "
"for incoming data to be read, the second contains objects that will "
"receive outgoing data when there is room in their buffer, and the third "
"those that may have an error (usually a combination of the input and "
"output channel objects).  The next step in the server is to set up the "
"lists containing input sources and output destinations to be passed to "
"``select()``."

#: ../../source/select/index.rst:62
msgid ""
"Connections are added to and removed from these lists by the server main "
"loop.  Since this version of the server is going to wait for a socket to "
"become writable before sending any data (instead of immediately sending "
"the reply), each output connection needs a queue to act as a buffer for "
"the data to be sent through it."

"``select()`` returns three new lists, containing subsets of the contents "
"of the lists passed in.  All of the sockets in the ``readable`` list have"
" incoming data buffered and available to be read.  All of the sockets in "
"the ``writable`` list have free space in their buffer and can be written "
"to.  The sockets returned in ``exceptional`` have had an error (the "
"actual definition of \"exceptional condition\" depends on the platform)."

"The \"readable\" sockets represent three possible cases.  If the socket "
"is the main \"server\" socket, the one being used to listen for "

" the list of inputs to monitor, this section sets the client socket to "
"not block."

"There are fewer cases for the writable connections.  If there is data in "

"``select()`` also takes an optional fourth parameter, which is the number"
