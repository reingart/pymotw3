"The most common use of ``SMTP`` is to connect to a mail server and send a"
" message.  The mail server host name and port can be passed to the "
"constructor, or ``connect()`` can be invoked explicitly. Once connected, "
"call ``sendmail()`` with the envelope parameters and body of the message."
"  The message text should be fully formed and comply with RFC 5322, since"
" ``smtplib`` does not modify the contents or headers at all.  That means "
"the ``From`` and ``To`` headers need to be added by the caller."

"The second argument to ``sendmail()``, the recipients, is passed as a "
"list.  Any number of addresses can be included in the list to have the "
"message delivered to each of them in turn.  Since the envelope "
"information is separate from the message headers, it is possible to blind"
" carbon-copy (BCC) someone by including them in the method argument, but "
"not in the message header."

msgid ""
"The ``SMTP`` class also handles authentication and TLS (transport layer "
"security) encryption, when the server supports them.  To determine if the"
" server supports TLS, call ``ehlo()`` directly to identify the client to "
"the server and ask it what extensions are available.  Then call "
"``has_extn()`` to check the results.  After TLS is started, ``ehlo()`` "
"must be called again before authenticating. Many mail hosting providers "
"now *only* support TLS-based connections. For communicating with those "
"servers, use ``SMTP_SSL`` to start off with an encrypted connection."

msgid ""
"The SMTP protocol includes a command to ask a server whether an address "
"is valid.  Usually ``VRFY`` is disabled to prevent spammers from finding "
"legitimate email addresses, but if it is enabled a client can ask the "
"server about an address and receive a status code indicating validity "
"along with the user's full name, if it is available."
