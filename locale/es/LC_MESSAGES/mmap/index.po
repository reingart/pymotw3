"Memory-mapping a file uses the operating system virtual memory system to "
"access the data on the file system directly, instead of using normal I/O "
"functions.  Memory-mapping typically improves I/O performance because it "
"does not involve a separate system call for each access and it does not "
"require copying data between buffers -- the memory is accessed directly "
"by both the kernel and the user application."

"Memory-mapped files can be treated as mutable strings or file-like "
"objects, depending on the need. A mapped file supports the expected file "
"API methods, such as ``close()``, ``flush()``, ``read()``, "
"``readline()``, ``seek()``, ``tell()``, and ``write()``. It also supports"
" the string API, with features such as slicing and methods like "
"``find()``."

"Use the ``mmap()`` function to create a memory-mapped file.  The first "
"argument is a file descriptor, either from the ``fileno()`` method of a "
"``file`` object or from ``os.open()``. The caller is responsible for "
"opening the file before invoking ``mmap()``, and closing it after it is "
"no longer needed."

"The second argument to ``mmap()`` is a size in bytes for the portion of "
"the file to map. If the value is ``0``, the entire file is mapped. If the"
" size is larger than the current size of the file, the file is extended."

"An optional keyword argument, ``access``, is supported by both platforms."
" Use ``ACCESS_READ`` for read-only access, ``ACCESS_WRITE`` for write-"

"The file pointer tracks the last byte accessed through a slice operation."
"  In this example, the pointer moves ahead 10 bytes after the first read."
"  It is then reset to the beginning of the file by the slice operation, "
"and moved ahead 10 bytes again by the slice.  After the slice operation, "
"calling ``read()`` again gives the bytes 11-20 in the file."

"To set up the memory mapped file to receive updates, start by opening it "

"to a slice, etc.)."
