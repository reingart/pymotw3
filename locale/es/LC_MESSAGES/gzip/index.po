"Different amounts of compression can be used by passing a "
"``compresslevel`` argument.  Valid values range from 0 to 9, inclusive. "
"Lower values are faster and result in less compression.  Higher values "
"are slower and compress more, up to a point."

"The ``GzipFile`` class can be used to wrap other types of data streams so"

":mod:`BytesIO` buffer can also be used."

msgid ""
"One benefit of using ``GzipFile`` over :mod:`zlib` is that it supports "
"the file API.  However, when re-reading the previously compressed data, "
"an explicit length is passed to ``read()``. Leaving the length off "
"resulted in a CRC error, possibly because ``BytesIO`` returned an empty "
"string before reporting EOF.  When working with streams of compressed "
"data, either prefix the data with an integer representing the actual "
"amount of data to be read or use the incremental decompression API in "
":mod:`zlib`."
