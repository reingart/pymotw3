"A *socket* is one endpoint of a communication channel used by programs to"
" pass data back and forth locally or across the Internet.  Sockets have "
"two primary properties controlling the way they send data: the *address "
"family* controls the OSI network layer protocol used and the *socket "
"type* controls the transport layer protocol."

"Python supports three address families.  The most common, ``AF_INET``, is"
" used for IPv4 Internet addressing.  IPv4 addresses are four bytes long "
"and are usually represented as a sequence of four numbers, one per octet,"
" separated by dots (e.g., ``10.1.1.5`` and ``127.0.0.1``).  These values "
"are more commonly referred to as \"IP addresses.\"  Almost all Internet "
"networking is done using IP version 4 at this time."

"``AF_INET6`` is used for IPv6 Internet addressing.  IPv6 is the \"next "
"generation\" version of the Internet protocol, and supports 128-bit "
"addresses, traffic shaping, and routing features not available under "
"IPv4.  Adoption of IPv6 continues to grow, especially with the "
"proliferation of cloud computing and the extra devices being added to the"
" network because of Internet-of-things projects."

"``AF_UNIX`` is the address family for Unix Domain Sockets (UDS), an "
"inter-process communication protocol available on POSIX-compliant "
"systems.  The implementation of UDS typically allows the operating system"
" to pass data directly from process to process, without going through the"
" network stack.  This is more efficient than using ``AF_INET``, but "
"because the file system is used as the namespace for addressing, UDS is "
"restricted to processes on the same system. The appeal of using UDS over "
"other IPC mechanisms such as named pipes or shared memory is that the "
"programming interface is the same as for IP networking, so the "
"application can take advantage of efficient communication when running on"
" a single host, but use the same code when sending data across the "
"network."

"The socket type is usually either ``SOCK_DGRAM`` for message-oriented "
"datagram transport or ``SOCK_STREAM`` for stream-oriented transport. "
"Datagram sockets are most often associated with UDP, the *user datagram "
"protocol*. They provide unreliable delivery of individual messages. "
"Stream-oriented sockets are associated with TCP, *transmission control "
"protocol*. They provide byte streams between the client and server, "
"ensuring message delivery or failure notification through timeout "
"management, retransmission, and other features."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/socket/addressing.rst:53
msgid ""
"Most application protocols that deliver a large amount of data, such as "
"HTTP, are built on top of TCP because it makes it simpler to create "
"complex applications when message ordering and delivery is handled "
"automatically. UDP is commonly used for protocols where order is less "
"important (since the messages are self-contained and often small, such as"
" name look-ups via DNS), or for *multicasting* (sending the same data to "
"several hosts). Both UDP and TCP can be used with either IPv4 or IPv6 "
"addressing."
