"By default, a ``socket`` is configured so that sending or receiving data "
"*blocks*, stopping program execution until the socket is ready.  Calls to"
" ``send()`` wait for buffer space to be available for the outgoing data, "
"and calls to ``recv()`` wait for the other program to send data that can "
"be read.  This form of I/O operation is easy to understand, but can lead "
"to inefficient operation and even deadlocks, if both programs end up "
"waiting for the other to send or receive data."

"There are a few ways to work around this situation.  One is to use a "
"separate thread for communicating with each socket.  This can introduce "
"other complexities, though, with communication between the threads.  "
"Another option is to change the socket to not block at all, and return "
"immediately if it is not ready to handle the operation. Use the "
"``setblocking()`` method to change the blocking flag for a socket.  The "
"default value is ``1``, which means to block.  Passing a value of ``0`` "
"turns off blocking.  If the socket is has blocking turned off and it is "
"not ready for the operation, then ``socket.error`` is raised."

"A compromise solution is to set a timeout value for socket operations. "
"Use ``settimeout()`` to change the timeout of a ``socket`` to a floating "
"point value representing the number of seconds to block before deciding "
"the socket is not ready for the operation.  When the timeout expires, a "
"``timeout`` exception is raised."
