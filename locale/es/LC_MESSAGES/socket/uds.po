"From the programmer's perspective there are two essential differences "
"between using a Unix domain socket and an TCP/IP socket.  First, the "
"address of the socket is a path on the file system, rather than a tuple "
"containing the server name and port.  Second, the node created in the "
"file system to represent the socket persists after the socket is closed, "
"and needs to be removed each time the server starts up.  The echo server "
"example from earlier can be updated to use UDS by making a few changes in"
" the setup section."

#: ../../source/socket/uds.rst:14
msgid ""
"The ``socket`` needs to be created with address family ``AF_UNIX``. "
"Binding the socket and managing the incoming connections works the same "
"as with TCP/IP sockets."

#: ../../source/socket/uds.rst:22
msgid ""
"The client setup also needs to be modified to work with UDS.  It should "
"assume the file system node for the socket exists, since the server "
"creates it by binding to the address.  Sending and receiving data works "
"the same way in the UDS client as the TCP/IP client from before."

"The program output is mostly the same, with appropriate updates for the "
"address information.  The server shows the messages received and sent "
"back to the client."

"The client sends the message all at once, and receives parts of it back "
"incrementally."

msgid ""
"Since the UDS socket is represented by a node on the file system, "
"standard file system permissions can be used to control access to the "
"server."

msgid ""
"Running the client as a user other than ``root`` now results in an error "
"because the process does not have permission to open the socket."

#: ../../source/socket/uds.rst:105
msgid ""
"The ``socketpair()`` function is useful for setting up UDS sockets for "
"inter-process communication under Unix.  It creates a pair of connected "
"sockets that can be used to communicate between a parent process and a "
"child process after the child is forked."

"By default, a UDS socket is created, but the caller can also pass address"
" family, socket type, and even protocol options to control how the "
"sockets are created."
