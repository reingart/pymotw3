"Sockets can be configured to act as a *server* and listen for incoming "
"messages, or connect to other applications as a *client*.  After both "
"ends of a TCP/IP socket are connected, communication is bi-directional."

"This sample program, based on the one in the standard library "
"documentation, receives incoming messages and echos them back to the "
"sender.  It starts by creating a TCP/IP socket, then ``bind()`` is used "
"to associate the socket with the server address.  In this case, the "
"address is ``localhost``, referring to the current server, and the port "
"number is 10000."

"Calling ``listen()`` puts the socket into server mode, and ``accept()`` "
"waits for an incoming connection.  The integer argument is the number of "
"connections the system should queue up in the background before rejecting"
" new clients.  This example only expects to work with one connection at a"
" time."

msgid ""
"``accept()`` returns an open connection between the server and client, "
"along with the address of the client.  The connection is actually a "
"different socket on another port (assigned by the kernel). Data is read "
"from the connection with ``recv()`` and transmitted with ``sendall()``."

#: ../../source/socket/tcp.rst:37
msgid ""
"When communication with a client is finished, the connection needs to be "
"cleaned up using ``close()``.  This example uses a ``try:finally`` block "
"to ensure that ``close()`` is always called, even in the event of an "
"error."

"The client program sets up its ``socket`` differently from the way a "

"After the connection is established, data can be sent through the "

"the server. When the entire message is sent and a copy received, the "
"socket is closed to free up the port."

"TCP/IP clients can save a few steps by using the convenience function "

"``create_connection()`` uses ``getaddrinfo()`` to find candidate "
"connection parameters, and returns a ``socket`` opened with the first "

":attr:`type`, and :attr:`proto` attributes can be examined to determine "
"the type of ``socket`` being returned."

"It is important to bind a server to the correct address, so that clients "
"can communicate with it.  The previous examples all used ``'localhost'`` "
"as the IP address, which limits connections to clients running on the "
"same server.  Use a public address of the server, such as the value "
"returned by ``gethostname()``, to allow other hosts to connect.  This "
"example modifies the echo server to listen on an address specified via a "
"command line argument."

"Many servers have more than one network interface, and therefore more "
"than one IP address.  Rather than running separate copies of a service "
"bound to each IP address, use the special address ``INADDR_ANY`` to "
"listen on all addresses at the same time.  Although ``socket`` defines a "
"constant for ``INADDR_ANY``, it is an integer value and must be converted"
" to a dotted-notation string address before it can be passed to "
