msgid "shelve --- Persistent Storage of Objects"

msgid ""
"The shelve module implements persistent storage for arbitrary Python "
"objects that can be pickled, using a dictionary-like API."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/shelve/index.rst:12
msgid ""
"The ``shelve`` module can be used as a simple persistent storage option "
"for Python objects when a relational database is not required. The shelf "
"is accessed by keys, just as with a dictionary. The values are pickled "
"and written to a database created and managed by :mod:`dbm`."

"The simplest way to use ``shelve`` is via the ``DbfilenameShelf`` class. "
"It uses :mod:`dbm` to store the data. The class can be used directly, or "
"by calling ``shelve.open()``."

"The :mod:`dbm` module does not support multiple applications writing to "
"the same database at the same time, but it does support concurrent read-"
"only clients. If a client will not be modifying the shelf, tell "
"``shelve`` to open the database read-only by passing ``flag='r'``."

"If the program tries to modify the database while it is opened read-only,"
" an access error exception is generated. The exception type depends on "

msgid "Write-back"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/shelve/index.rst:81
msgid ""
"Shelves do not track modifications to volatile objects, by default. That "
"means if the contents of an item stored in the shelf are changed, the "
"shelf must be updated explicitly by storing the entire item again."

msgid ""
"In this example, the dictionary at ``'key1'`` is not stored again, so "
"when the shelf is re-opened, the changes have not been preserved."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/shelve/index.rst:108
msgid ""
"To automatically catch changes to volatile objects stored in the shelf, "
"open it with writeback enabled. The ``writeback`` flag causes the shelf "
"to remember all of the objects retrieved from the database using an in-"
"memory cache. Each cache object is also written back to the database when"
" the shelf is closed."

msgid "shelve_writeback.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/shelve/index.rst:118
msgid ""
"Although it reduces the chance of programmer error, and can make object "
"persistence more transparent, using writeback mode may not be desirable "
"in every situation. The cache consumes extra memory while the shelf is "
"open, and pausing to write every cached object back to the database when "
"it is closed slows down the application.  All of the cached objects are "
"written back to the database because there is no way to tell if they have"
" been modified. If the application reads data more than it writes, "
"writeback will impact performance unnecessarily."

"The earlier examples all used the default shelf implementation. Using "
"``shelve.open()`` instead of one of the shelf implementations directly is"
" a common usage pattern, especially if it does not matter what type of "
"database is used to store the data. There are times, however, when the "
"database format is important. In those situations, use "
"``DbfilenameShelf`` or ``BsdDbShelf`` directly, or even subclass "
"``Shelf`` for a custom solution."
